https://materialdistrict.com/material/013-denim/,013 Denim,Other naturals,ONA791,Netherlands,013 Denim,"013 Denim is made 50% from recycled denim garments from Tilburg and 50% from organic cotton yarn from India. For the first production, the denim garments were collected in February 2017 by residents of Tilburg and 6 primary schools in the city. The denim garments were then recycled into denim yarn by the textile company Wolkat in Morocco. The Indian cotton comes from Indian cotton farmers who get a better price for their cotton. Rabobank Foundation finances these types of cooperatives in South India with microcredits. The two yarns were woven together by Wolkat in Morocco into a new, sustainable textile fabric.

The yarns of 013 Denim symbolize the yarns that connect Tilburg as a city: the best of business, culture, education and citizens are literally and figuratively interwoven. In addition, the fabric tells a special story about the way in which this fabric was created. Students of ROC Tilburg, School for Fashion and Tilburg artist Joris van Spaendonck used 013 Denim for a large work of art and various products that were presented to the Dutch royal family on King’s Day. Teachers from Fontys Academy for Creative Industries contributed ideas about the presentation on King’s Day.

The denim is supported by various parties in Tilburg who honour Tilburg’s textile past and want to work with textile in an innovative and sustainable way. The participating parties are: 013 Straatjes, Wolkat 100% circular recycling, Fontys Academy for Creative Industries, Michel Klop Fotografie, Rabobank Tilburg, ROC Tilburg | School for Fashion and VeertienElf Media. The project is supported by City marketing Tilburg, De Kerf & Van Sprang notaries, Municipality of Tilburg, Interpolis, Rabobank Foundation and Van Boekel Smits & Willems. Other parties that are part of the Tilburg Textile Group: Bonheur Horeca Groep, Havep, Innofa, Joris van Spaendonck, TextielMuseum and Tricorp.","Biobased, Recycling, Sustainable, Other naturals, fabric, textile",Matte,0-50%,Open,Smooth,Soft,Warm,Moderate,None,Moderate,Good,Moderate,Moderate,Light,Poor,Yes

The process of designing and producing these fabrics is complicated. In each of the 27 treatments the wax fabric goes through, things can go wrong. Safeguarding their quality standard, Vlisco cannot bring the misprints to market. Only the best of the best goes to Africa.

Simone Post has developed a line of high-quality carpets using Vlisco’s rejects. Whereas destruction of the leftover and rejected textiles is time consuming and a waste of all the energy that went into creating the cloth, recycling is environmentally sustainable and also offers a challenging platform for innovation. The ‘waste’ is made in the Netherlands and the carpets are produced locally in Post’s own studio in the Netherlands as well, keeping the transport impact very low.

Inspired by the side view of the large rolls used to store and transport the textiles, the fabrics are cut into thin strips and then folded and coiled into sturdy carpets.

A key difference with 3D printing is the use of an ultraviolet hardening ink. A UV lamp integrated in the print head dries the CMYK ink as it is printed. This texture has a decorative effect, with the small, raised ink deposits forming full-colour patterns across the printed area. With their ‘Elevated Graphics’ collection, designers Jannie Schmitz and Daan de Haan have created a range of highly detailed relief in full colour.

This collection is produced with Océ High Resolution print technology. Other applications of the technique could include printing relief containing information for the poorly sighted. Replicas of works of art are also possible, which would, for instance, allow visitors to a museum to touch realistic copies of famous paintings.

The maximum printing size of a panel is 250 cm x 125 cm The maximum elevation height is 10mm.

Every colour is possible in the CMYK range.

Material: the printing surface must be flat and rigid. The surface material can be GatorFoam, Dibond or acrylic (PMMA) in various thinknesses. Special materials like wood, metal or glass and mirrors are also possible.

One of the current uses for Low & Bonar’s material Colback is its implementation in the automotive industry, where it is incorporated in the upholstery of car interiors.

Having researched the materials that comprise car upholstery, Joris shifted his focus towards the moulding of the material. In the research and development center of Low & Bonar, the quality of the material is tested in order to minimize irregularities within the interior. A linear pattern is applied in this moulding process, to monitor the ways in which the material behaves when it is formed. Inspired by this process, Joris appropriated the technology in a new way by converting it to form shoes. During this process, he explored the tufted Colback material by playing with the linear patterns; the details and inconsistencies that emerged constitute the aesthetic character of his collection. These reveal the techniques as well as the materials behind the design.

From the tufted and moulded material of the body and the carpeting, to the finishing procedures of car mats that round off the edges of the design, the diverse range of techniques that are applied in the manufacturing of car interiors come together in this collection of shoes.

Carbon is lighter and stronger than glass so where weight needs to be the minimum this is the backing to use with Aestetica. The composite qualities are enhanced with a UV stabiliser in the epoxy resin. Epoxy systems are tough and durable. You can choose the fabric to suit the piece you want to make and the style you wish to achieve. Lacquered finishes mean that matt, gloss and other special finishes can make your item unique.

Composites are used to build aircraft, cars, bridges and boats, and all attention goes to the technical performance.

These composites are also beautiful.

One of the most recent techniques for making composite components is by using prepreg fibre reinforcement, cured under heat and pressure to produce professional quality parts with a high quality surface finish and low resin content. An uncured fibre is easy to handle and can be cut and laid precisely into the moulds making the process ideal for smaller, complex parts.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/3d-metal/,3D Metal,Metals,MET278,Netherlands,3D Metal-Forming,"High Energy Hydroforming (HEH) is the process of forming sheet/thick plate metal using explosive materials. In general, a metal sheet is placed on a die. The die cavity is vacuumed and the assembly is placed in water. An explosive charge is detonated under water pushing the sheet into the die in about 2 milliseconds. HEH offers unique technical opportunities because it can be applied in any shape (double curved) and mass. Sizes range currently up to 8×2 meters or 5×5 meters, with thicknesses from 0.3 mm aluminium to 150 mm stainless steel, for example. Many types of aluminium, titanium, stainless steel, Invar and nickel have been successfully formed by 3D Metal Forming processes.

Every new project starts with FEM simulation of the metal forming process in order to optimize the forming steps. The shape of the blank material can be optimized for any product shape. Sheets can be formed from flat or bent condition, or from a conical or cylindrical shape. Sheets and tubes can be formed in welded condition, even when the welded sheets have different thicknesses. Good results have been achieved in steel (MIG and electrode welding), stainless steel, nickel alloys (laser and TIG welding) and aluminum (TIG and friction stir welding).

The tooling for HEH is relatively simple. One die half is needed without a mating part. Low cost tooling concepts decrease costs further. Prototypes can be delivered quickly. The tooling does not need to be installed in a machine so that production can be started immediately.

3D Metal Forming has vast experience in making parts for the aerospace industry, energy / big science market and for special high end architectural projects. Expensive joining operations can be saved by HEH because complex and large shapes can be formed in one piece. Even larger and more complex shapes can be formed by welding the sheets prior to forming.

Hydroforming allows complex shapes with concavities to be formed, which would be difficult or impossible with standard solid die stamping. The aluminum is placed inside a negative mold that has the shape of the desired end result. High pressure hydraulic pistons inject a fluid at very high pressure inside the aluminum which causes it to expand until it matches the mold. 3D Plate can be used for inside and outside and are available in many sizes available upon request.",Metals,Matte,0%,Open,Coarse,Hard,Cool,Poor,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Medium,Good,No
https://materialdistrict.com/material/3d-print-on-stretch-fabric/,3D print on stretch fabric,,PLA1283,Netherlands,LABELEDBY.,"LABELEDBY. is a research and technological development studio, based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, focusing on the possibilities of new techniques as 3D printing in combination with textile. By 3D printing on textile, the fabric’s shape becomes permanent.

For Ocean, inspiration from nature leaded towards the form of this sample. LABELEDBY. tried to transform the feeling of ocean residents into a tangible sample. The flow and flexibility of a jellyfish inspired to create a flexible structure, that, at the same time, mimicked the rigid look of coral in the ocean. Using semi hard material in combination with flexible fabric forms an unstationary shape.

The 3D printer was used to print a 2D pattern on flat textile. The stretch in the textile creates the 3D form that pops up after 3D printing.

For generating this 2D pattern, digital mathematical functions were used. Using patterns that are generated through mathematics provide the freedom in the sense of fast adaptability. Due to the digital functions LABELEDBY. can easily generate a lot of different forms. Therefore, it becomes easier to do a lot of testing and sampling in a small amount of time to find the right balance between the stretch of the fabric and the pattern.

Using digital manufacturing techniques and digital functions brings us a step closer towards automation in textile.

The Flat Diamond sample is a part of the studio’s research on how to mimic authentic craftsmanship using digital manufacturing techniques. Using digital manufacturing techniques and digital functions brings us a step closer towards automation in textile. Smocking is a labor-intensive embroidery technique, practiced since the Middle Ages. The technique was used in garments to create flexibility in non-stretchable fabric in necklines and bodices.

LABELEDBY. tried to mimic the feel of this technique by 3D printing directly onto textile. By stretching the tule in the right ratio and 3D print on top of it we created equilibrium in this pop-up smocking sample.

Potential application of this new material is using the repeated structure in acoustic wall panels to regulate reverberation of sound.","Concept, Innovation, 3D printing, additive manufacturing, fabric, textile",Variable,0-50%,Open,Medium,Resilient,Medium,Moderate,None,Unknown,Unknown,Poor,Poor,Light,Moderate,No

The slats are attached to each other by means of aluminium tubes or plywood strips. It is a wooden ceiling system that not only provides a warm atmosphere in the room, but is also acoustic, practical and easy to install. In addition, it is an ideal solution for concealing the ceiling construction or cabling. The grilles give great design freedom due to the variety of surfaces, widths and lengths.

Ceiling system with great design freedom The Acoustic Grilles offer architects and designers great freedom of design. The vertical slats can be produced individually and you can choose from different surfaces, widths and lengths. By choosing different dimensions and/or surfaces within a grill, you can give the Acoustic Grill its own character. The variety of surfaces range from wood veneer to laminate, stained and lacquered finishes to our lightweight concrete or stone veneer surfaces. The grilles can be combined with different types of lighting and systems. The panels can be mounted on the ceiling as well as on the wall or opt for the Acoustic RibPanel for the walls. Acoustic Grilles ceiling panels Acoustic comfort has a major influence on how a room is experienced. A room with a lot of reverberation sounds very hollow. This is due to a large reverberation of the sound, often caused by hard and smooth materials. The Acoustic Grilles guide the sound waves between the slats and thus offer an ideal acoustic solution. The natural character of the wood gives the room a modern and warm atmosphere. For the best acoustic effectiveness, choose the correct height and arrangement for the room.

Nicknames include ‘frozen smoke, solid smoke, solid air, or blue smoke,’ owing to its translucent nature and the way light scatters in the material.

Aerogel first became known as the insulation material used in the Pathfinder research vehicle that travelled across the surface of Mars. Since that time, research has been carried on into the use of aerogel for ’terrestrial’ applications, e.g. as insulation material for houses and other buildings.

Aerogels are irregularly shaped particles, ranging from about 0.5mm to 4.0mm in size depending on grade. Their primary use is in daylighting applications, where visible light is required to pass through a daylighting unit which still maintains excellent thermal insulation.

Aerogel uses a combination of mineral acid and beach sand that has been dissolved in a liquid known as ’water glass’ (a solution of sodium silicate). When this liquid is combined with an acid, it coalesces to form a silica gel. The pores of the gel contain water, but the gel is low in solids and is capable of producing a low-density dry gel. When the liquid is extracted from the gel, e.g. by evaporation, it shrinks and collapses, just like a kitchen sponge.","Lightweight, Sustainable, Plastics",Glossy,50-100%,Closed,Medium,Hard,Warm,Good,None,Good,Good,Good,Moderate,Light,Moderate,No

One of the most recent techniques for making composite components is by using prepreg fibre reinforcement, cured under heat and pressure to produce professional quality parts with a high quality surface finish and low resin content. An uncured fibre is easy to handle and can be cut and laid precisely into the moulds making the process ideal for smaller, complex parts. The ease and accuracy with which the material can be templated and cut means that material can be used very efficiently; significantly reducing waste compared to other manufacturing techniques.","Lightweight, Sense & Sensibility, Other naturals",Satin,0%,Closed,Smooth,Hard,Warm,Poor,None,Moderate,Moderate,Moderate,Good,Light,Good,No

The substance is extracted from red algae, which are native to water bodies around the world. Carolyn Raff Studio obtains the agar agar from Spain and Morocco as these have relatively short transport routes.

The agar agar is boiled with natural dyes, glycerol and water, and is then gelled. After that, the material is dried with the residual heat from a nearby biogas plant and is ready for further processing.

Depending on its composition, the biopolymer behaves similarly to latex or PVC. When in contact with water, the material softens. Once dry, the material is a little stiffer than it was before contact. This is due to the water solubility of glycerol. Glycerol acts as a natural plasticizer in the material. Glycerol is a sugar alcohol and is found in all natural fats and vegetable oils and is used in the food and pharmaceutical industries.

In order to ensure the compostability and thus the environmental compatibility of our material, there is no coating to achieve water resistance.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/aluminium-foam/,Aluminium foam,Metals,MET002,Germany,AlCarbon Technologie GmbH,"Research into and development of aluminium foam has made enormous progress in recent years. From being a laboratory material about which in the last ten years few scientists were fully informed, aluminium foam has definitely made the leap to industrial application. The number of different types of aluminium foam has risen exponentially. Each type has its own specific properties, properties which make it unique and make possible completely new product applications. Aluminium foams are pre-eminently suitable for applications which are innovative and revolutionary. AlCarbon sees innovation as involving the development of new products, where the benefits of aluminium foam are taken into account during the product development phase. Innovation does not however mean replacing a part of an existing product by aluminium foam: AlCarbon considers that a retrograde step. AlCarbon has made it its business to market aluminium foam, once no more than an object of scientific research, as a ready-made product. Close cooperation with IFAM in Bremen, the birthplace of Foaminal® and other foams, and cooperation with Schunk Kohlenstofftechnik GmbH, producer of Foaminal® and ALFS foam, Gleich GmbH, importer of Alporas® foam, and Empore, manufacturer of an aluminium foam with an open cell structure, has put AlCarbon into a position in which it can apply the newest developments and discoveries to its products, straight from the laboratory. This has enabled AlCarbon to put on the market the world’s first commercially feasible aluminium foam product, a crumple zone for motorcycles,large parts of which are ideally made of Foaminal® aluminium foam. This crumple zone is lighter than any crumple zone produced so far and is considerably better at absorbing the energy released in a crash. Sheets of Foaminal are also eminently suitable for lamination, e.g. with carbon fibre reinforced plastic, to create a light rigid sheet.

AlCarbon products consist of a metal foam core (mainly aluminium foam) with coatings of carbon, glass or aramid fibre reinforced plastic, or metallic coatings in e.g. aluminium or steel. AlCarbon can supply its material in a number of different variants, e.g. as pure aluminium foam in aluminium foam sheets, aluminium foam profiles and aluminium foam shaped building components or as the core material in sandwich sheets, profiles and shaped building components. The sheets can be used for a variety of different applications. For technical applications added value is created by their good rigidity, heat resistance, sound absorption, resistance to impact and fire and explosion safety. They can also be used as lightweight pallets, wall and floor coverings, sandwich sheets for recreational and sporting areas and vibration-free steps. Finally, they can be used for desktops, table tops, kitchen worktops in and decorative floor and wall elements. Pure aluminium foam is supplied under the following brand names: – FOAMINAL® -AC – pure aluminium foam in FOAMINAL foam for sheets, profiles and shaped building components with a sealed exterior coating – ALPORAS®-AC -pure aluminium foam in ALPORAS foam for sheets with surfaces with open pores – EMPORE®-AC – pure aluminium foam in foam with an open cell structure (no cell walls) in a density of 10 or 20 pores per inch, for sheets and profiles.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/aluminium-mesh/,Aluminium mesh,Metals,MET105,Germany,Mayser,"Metal foams, full of tiny air bubbles like a sponge cake, are gradually making inroads in industrial applications. Lightness and high energy absorption are two demanded material characteristics. The most common technique for manufacturing metal foams involves mixing metal powders with blowing agents. When mixture gets heated approaching melting point, the additive releases a gas which creates a mass of bubbles in the metal. However open-pored foam panels cannot be manufactured this way, because the pores extend through from one face to the other. An expanding gas would simply escape through the holes. Therefore M-pore employs a casting method; A mold cut in polyurethane foam is coated with wax. The cavity is filled with a heat-resistant ceramic paste. When liquid metal is poured into the mold – mostly aluminum at around 700 °C –, the plastic foam burns away, leaving behind a metal “sponge” filled with pores with diameters of between one and five millimeters. The final step is to blast off the ceramic mold with a water jet. M-Pore produces open celled metal foams in a wide range of alloys (Sn, Al, Cu, Au, Ag or Fe).",Metals,Matte,0%,Closed,Medium,Hard,Medium,Poor,None,Moderate,Good,Good,Moderate,Light,Moderate,No

The different types of finishes are grouped into seven categories described below. Follow the links to see more about each group.

Technical: Technical finishes combine precise geometric shapes into simple and complex patterns for an endless array of options. High contrast or tone on tone looks work well with this group of finishes. Most take advantage of the metal substrate allowing the reflective surface to show though. In addition, they often use printed texture to add visual and tactile interest.

3D: Textured, tinted and brushed effects give a technical edge to geometric grids and woven structures. Careful registration creates precise metal finishes. Selective brushing and texture add movement and depth to the patterns.

Woven: This group of dynamic aluminium finishes depend on selective brushing layered with transparent tints of colour and texture for the kinetic effects apparent in real carbon fiber trim.

Linear: Manipulated surfaces are layered together creating organic linear structures with striations of brush and texture adding dimension.

Modern: Simple clean design combines technology and material to create modern surfaces.

Simple: Extreme simplification of shapes in stepped repetition on basic brushed aluminium. High contrast bold texture joins authentic metal.

Ornamental: Finishes are involved, detailed, gilded and elaborate creating bejeweled, cultivated and flamboyant surfaces.

Worn: Aged and patinated surfaces combine warm and cool metal colors for a mixed metal effect. Authentic distressed metal finishes create an industrial look.","Lightweight, Metals",Satin,0%,Open,Medium,Hard,Medium,Moderate,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Light,Good,No

The tone is a muted, warm brown with subtle metallic variation, designed to complement both contemporary and traditional material palettes.

This finish is achieved through Alumet’s electrolytic anodizing process, which forms an oxide layer integrated into the aluminium surface. Colour is introduced using metal salt deposition within the anodic layer, eliminating the need for organic dyes or surface coatings. The result is a highly UV-stable, weather-resistant surface with uniform colouring across panels, while preserving the depth and texture inherent to the anodizing process.

Material and Technical Properties

The finish is resistant to mechanical wear, atmospheric corrosion, and does not develop surface patina over time. In contrast to natural copper, AluOldCopper does not oxidize, discolour adjacent materials, or change appearance due to environmental exposure.

Application and Specification Context AluOldCopper is intended for architectural projects where a reference to copper aesthetics is desired, but where long-term colour stability, lightweight construction, and reduced maintenance requirements are critical. The finish is commonly specified for:

Its neutral, warm tone allows it to be combined effectively with materials such as stone, glass, and untreated wood, particularly in contexts where natural material compatibility is a design priority.

Amber is high-priced, but tonnes of amber dust disappear down the sewer because the industry sees it as a low-grade material.

Amber is fossilized tree resin derived from extinct resin-bearing trees. It belongs to the organic semi-precious stones. Fossilization of the resin takes millions of years. Although deposits of amber occur throughout the world, amber from the coast of the Baltic Sea is the best-known. Because amber floats on saltwater, many pieces wash ashore on the beaches of Poland and Lithuania. Worked amber is dating back to 11,000 B.C. Amber was and is used to make varnish, incense, decorative objects, jewellery and medicine. The production of jewellery and carving is usually done by hand with tools such as saws, fine-toothed files, drills, diamond disks, and sandpaper. After crafting amber there is left a huge amount of waste called amber dust. It can accumulate in tonnes and just a small amount of it is being sold. Mostly because it is contaminated with sandpaper and thus the value is lost. It is disposed of into dumpsters or even sewage.

Today around 90% of the world’s amber comes from the Baltic region. China is amber’s biggest market. The good-quality amber from the Baltic region is sold to China, leaving an imported lower-quality amber. Amber mining and processing have caused widespread environmental degradation. More than 100 million tonnes of waste have been discharged into the Baltic from the Yantarny mine in Kaliningrad over the past century. The high Chinese demand caused the establishment of the black market, which is primarily located in Ukraine, Russia, and Myanmar. The mining technique itself completely decimates the soil, making it incapable of sustaining plant life. By comparing fossils of the species and ecosystems in amber, scientists are starting to tackle giant questions about extinction, conservation, and the evolutionary history of the species we see today. Though thousands of specimens do find their way into the hands of scientists, many more are put to industrial or decorative use.

Amber is a natural bio-resin, which is becoming soft at 150 C degrees and starting to melt at 250-300 C degrees. A full scope of material research is conducted by softening and melting the amber dust, creating methods, analyzing properties, deconstructing it by adding new biomaterials and binders, altering its properties, and changing colours. Amber is transformed into completely new material to create a range of usable more cost-effective interior products, such as panels, tiles, and furniture parts. The great inspiration is The Amber Room, which is a reconstructed chamber decorated in amber panels located in the Catherine Palace near Saint Petersburg. Constructed in the 18th century in Prussia, the original Amber Room was dismantled and eventually disappeared during World War II. Currently to decorate the interior with amber would come with an extremely high cost, but it could become possible with a transformation of the amber dust.","Biobased, Recycling, Other naturals",Matte,50-100%,Closed,Variable,Hard,Medium,Moderate,Moderate,Unknown,Unknown,Poor,Moderate,Light,Poor,No

By experimenting with a range of different materials including paper, polyester, mohair and abaca, a number of structures were created that can be used as space creators or dividing screens, strong enough to be used on an architectural scale and incorporating various smart properties that allow them to adapt to their surroundings (such as acoustic, heat-sensitive, light-sensitive, etc.). By using these different materials, many different folded surface possibilities can be created including hard, technical, or soft and tactile.

The woven structures can also be folded into a myriad of different shapes thanks to their structural flexibility, allowing two identical products to be installed in completely unique manners, re-used in different shapes/sizes, installed permanently or temporarily, and easily transported or moved thanks to their compact fold.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/architectural-titanium/,Architectural Titanium,Metals,MET283,United States,Architectural Titanium,"Titanium is a relatively unknown and new material to choose of for facades, but its popularity is increasing.

The excellent corrosion resistance of architectural titanium results from the formation of a very stable, continuous surface. Because titanium metal itself is highly reactive and has an extremely high affinity for oxygen, a beneficial oxide film forms immediately when exposed to moisture or air. In fact, a damaged oxide film will restore itself instantaneously.

Titanium’s coefficient of thermal expansion is half that of stainless steel and copper and one-third of aluminium. It is virtually equal to that of glass and concrete. Consequently, thermal stress on titanium is very small. The specific gravity of titanium is 4.51, 60% that of steel, half that of copper and 1.7 that of aluminium. Being such a lightweight metal, titanium imposes less burden on structure and permits ease of fabrication.

Depending upon use, it eliminates the need for corrosion-combating expenses and enables further weight reduction. Along with its good mechanical strength, titanium is durable and shock resistant. Architectural titanium can be supplied in a variety of surface finishes and textures, like lineair brushed, smooth surface, textured roll and even a high polished mirror version. The subdued colour of natural titanium is popular due to its unique appearance. Many finishes are available in varying degrees of reflectivity.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/arfinio/,Arfinio®,Plastics,PLA1435,Germany,Covestro AG,"If you can imagine it, you can make it with Arfinio®. This solid surface technology from Covestro and Arcesso Dynamics enables seamless solid surfaces and brings impossible designs to life. Its high degree of scalability makes creating even complex shapes easy. Being truly seamless, Arfinio® has no joints or structural weak points, opening up new vistas in customization with tailor-made colouration and gloss levels, enabling designers to expand beyond an otherwise limited range of designs.

Arfinio® is a revolution in solid-surface manufacturing. It is a new manufacturing technology based on reaction injection moulding (RIM), a method that enables the development of truly seamless pieces in an industrialized way. Traditional RIM-produced materials are made with aromatic polyurethanes, which require a coating and are not light-stable. This makes them difficult to repair and limits their potential applications. However, until recently, RIM was only possible with this chemistry.

Together, Covestro and Arcesso were able to adapt the RIM process for aliphatic chemistry – something previously considered impossible. Using this method, they were able to create a material combining the benefits of solid surfaces and injection moulding, and overcoming their limitations. High-performance polymers and minerals are used to produce lightweight solid-surface materials without requiring sheets.

The injection moulding results in truly seamless surfaces, making them highly suitable for elements with built-in fittings like a shower plate or wash basin. Arfinio® comes in countless colours and gloss-levels and is incredibly lightweight – even the heaviest version is still 40% lighter than standard solid surface materials.

The moulded solid surfaces can be used to make everything from device casings to interior cladding and building facades to applications involving backlighting or the integration of electronics. This technology is particularly well suited for manufacturing products that are regularly exposed to water such as shower plates or bathtubs, because the resulting surfaces are non-slip, hygienic and easy to clean. Arfinio® also has highly effective insulating properties, thanks to its outstanding thermal coefficient when compared to standard solid surfaces.

Reaction injection moulding (RIM) saves time and is less complicated than solid sheet manufacturing. A specially designed mould creates the shape in a single step, so there is no need for thermoforming, CNC cutting, and gluing.

Design benefits at a glance:

Sustainability is a key criterion for any design or manufacturing task. Arfinio® makes it possible to use partially bio-based raw materials to create cladding for interiors, bathroom elements, fittings for lighting and much more – all of which helps to close the carbon loop. High impact resistance and easy repairability in case it is needed ensure these products have a long service life, after which they can be mechanically recycled into new Arfinio® products.","Innovation, Manufacture, Plastics, solid surface",Variable,0-50%,Closed,Smooth,Hard,Medium,Good,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Light,Good,No

https://materialdistrict.com/material/atex/,Atex,Plastics,PLA137,United Kingdom,Valmiera Glass UK Ltd.,"Since their development over 60 years ago, woven glass fibre fabrics have become indispensable throughout industry – mostly when used to reinforce materials such as polyester, epoxy and other resins. Originally the synthetic polymer silicone – chemically inert and thermally stable – was produced for use as a sealant or bonding agent. However the rapidly expanding market for fabric architecture prompted the increasing use of silicone for coating glass fibre fabrics. Atex from P-D Interglas Technologies Ltd is the culmination of this hi-tech development with applications for creating lightweight membrane structures that embrace a new contemporary freedom of form, lightness and ecological appeal. Atex meets the criteria of quality, strength, stability, corrosion and fire resistance in today’s modern fabric building culture of spectacular architecture. Four different membrane compositions are used: glass fibre fabric, silicone, polyurethane and fluoropolymer. Applications are in tensile structures, ceiling constructions, canopies, awnings and façade covers.

Invented by Sir John Herschel in 1842, first used as a mean of illustration and documentation by Anna Atkins, blueprint, or cyanotype, was repurposed to reproduce technical drawings for architectural and engineering projects. Reviving and interpreting this traditional knowledge, Atmospheric Wood aims to bring back this process to contemporary architecture.

The key element in this process is sunlight and, more specifically, its interaction with an UV light sensitive solution. While exposed to light, the process transforms untreated wood into an assortment of blue hues. In addition, a maze of pointillist patterns is created using a scattered application of natural minerals. The results vary depending on the environmental conditions during production and types of wood used.","Sense & Sensibility, Wood",Matte,0%,Closed,Smooth,Hard,Warm,Moderate,None,Poor,Good,Moderate,Good,Medium,Poor,Yes

https://materialdistrict.com/material/avocado-seed-bricks/,Avocado Seed Bricks,Other naturals,ONA1119,United States,Matter Matters,"These unique bricks are crafted from discarded avocado seeds, a sustainable and eco-friendly material repurposed from a Mexican restaurant. Each brick’s creation begins with the collection of raw avocado seeds, a free and abundant resource gathered weekly. These seeds, once discarded as waste, are carefully processed to transform them into a durable building material. The process starts with the removal of excess pulp, ensuring that only the firm seed remains. The husks are stripped away, and the seeds are then grated into small particles. This fine-grained material is spread out to dry under the hot, dry sun of southwest Texas. The intense desert heat accelerates the drying process, turning the seed particles into a workable texture.

After a full day of sun exposure, the dried avocado seed material is ready to be mixed with a natural binder. This binder acts as a binding agent, holding the grated seeds together and ensuring the finished brick is both sturdy and stable. The combination of the grated avocado seed material and the natural binder results in a cohesive mixture that can be shaped into bricks.

To form these innovative bricks, the mixture is placed into a 3D printed mould, a modern technique that allows for precise and uniform shaping. The use of 3D printing also allows for intricate mould designs and customization based on specific project needs. The mould helps to set the shape of the brick, and once the material has been properly placed, the brick is left to cure.

The resulting bricks are not only durable but also embody a story of sustainability and resourcefulness. By repurposing avocado seeds, this process diverts organic waste from landfills and turns it into a valuable resource for construction. The bricks produced have a distinctive texture, with the natural grain and color of the avocado seed visible in the final product. This provides a unique aesthetic that reflects both the origin of the material and the careful process by which it was transformed.

These avocado seed bricks are ideal for use in a variety of building applications. They are lightweight yet strong, making them suitable for walls, partitions, or other structural elements in eco-conscious architecture. The use of locally sourced, renewable materials also ensures that the environmental footprint of each brick is minimal, making them a responsible choice for sustainable construction projects.

By utilizing discarded avocado seeds, this innovative brick-making process offers a novel approach to sustainable building materials, turning waste into a valuable resource while helping to reduce the ecological impact of construction.","Biobased, Other naturals, 3D printing, bricks",Matte,0%,Closed,Coarse,Hard,Medium,Moderate,None,Unknown,Unknown,Moderate,Good,Light,Moderate,Yes

Due to the high demand, bamboo specialist MOSO has now extended the collection with four variants. In addition to the introduction of the new Natural White colour and a new surface finish, MOSO has also upgraded the flooring’s technical functions: increased stability with a significantly wider plank and a click system for comfortable floating installation. As one of the most sustainable floors currently available on the market and with its fresh appearance, it is certainly a contemporary and aesthetic choice.

Extra wide to give a luxurious look The XXL format doesn’t only make rooms look more spacious, it also gives them an extra touch of luxury. The dimensions are reminiscent of the parquet planks in stately mansions. To further enhance this look, the MOSO Bamboo Elite Premium boards have a width of 190 mm. That’s another 31 mm more than the original Bamboo Elite flooring, which are as wide as 159 mm, and already wider than most conventional bamboo floors. This new plank size is made possible by the improved stability of the cross-laminated bamboo middle layers. MOSO compresses the bamboo strips in an optimised manufacturing process. Thanks to the improved stability, Bamboo Elite Premium can also be installed floating on underfloor heating. However, for commercial applications with underfloor heating, MOSO recommends gluing the floor covering over the entire surface.

Contemporary bright colours The four new premium versions are available in two optics: Side Pressed and Density. The natural appearance of the sustainable bamboo flooring is accentuated by a very matt lacquer with delicate white tones. As with all MOSO flooring, special attention was paid to environmental aspects in the development of the four new products; in fact, they already comply with the new emission regulations that will come into force in Germany in 2020. In addition to the lacquered versions Caramel and Natural White, MOSO has also provided an oiled surface for the Side Pressed Caramel optics. Following the expansion of the collection, Bamboo Elite is now available in all bamboo structures and colours: Side Pressed, Plain Pressed and Density, each in Caramel and Natural colours.

Technical properties at the highest level Bamboo Elite Premium Density is very stable due to the symmetrical structure of an upper and lower layer of Density bamboo. The high Brinell hardness of up to 9.5 kg/mm² (EN 1534) makes it impressively wear resistant: It is more robust than any other classic parquet. MOSO confirms its long service life with a 30-year manufacturer’s warranty on Bamboo Elite Premium floors. These technical properties are complemented by the exceptionally high fire class of up to Bfl-s1 (Density versions, according to EN 13501-1), making Bamboo Elite Premium Density flooring particularly interesting not only for residential applications, but also for commercial properties such as offices, restaurants and retail stores.

For Bamboo UltraDensity, the bamboo stems are split into strips, then crushed and finally compressed into boards. This results in boards with an Ultra-High Density, which makes the bamboo extremely durable and suitable for almost any high traffic area. Bamboo UltraDensity is the only alternative to stone, ceramic, pvc or other industrial floors!

MOSO Bamboo UltraDensity is a solid bamboo flooring board made from compressed bamboo fibres. With a unique production method, the material is extremely stable, hard and durable and therefore suitable for the toughest conditions: in very high traffic areas and even in semi-outdoor (covered but not closed) areas. The boards are available unfinished, with rough sanded faces, and have to be finished on site. MOSO Bamboo UltraDensity flooring can meet the highest requirements, making it a unique product for the use of biobased materials in modern architecture.

Locations like train stations, airports, malls, or museums require special flooring with exceptional qualities, tested and certified to the highest standards. These very high performance standards are virtually impossible to achieve with wood flooring. The newly developed MOSO Bamboo UltraDensity flooring has reached the highest standards, proved by testing and certification in France. FCBA, the official French wood-institute, defined that all norms for solid and densified wood are valid for MOSO bamboo. After extensive testing, Bamboo UltraDensity reached the highest wear class, stability and mechanical property class. Combined with the testing for water and chemical resistance, the product has been certified by CSTB (French official construction institute) according to the UPEC classification with the score of U4P4C2E2. This proves that the Bamboo UltraDensity flooring is better than any other wood flooring.

With the opening of Bordeaux Saint Jean train station end of 2016, the first certified bamboo heavy duty flooring will be exposed to more than 18 million passengers per year. In 2017, MOSO Bamboo UltraDensity will also be installed in Gare du Nord train station in Paris with more than 180 million passengers per year!​","Other naturals, bamboo, flooring, hard floors",Matte,0%,Closed,Medium,Hard,Medium,Moderate,None,Good,Unknown,Moderate,Good,Heavy,Good,Yes
https://materialdistrict.com/material/bamboo-veneer/,Bamboo veneer,Other naturals,ONA637,Netherlands,Moso International,"The term veneer is commonly applied to any one of the thin layers or sheets of wood cut or sawed from a log, that are glued or otherwise bonded together to form plywood boards.

In the case of bamboo, there are several methods for obtaining different types of veneers. These methods are: rotary, sliced and sawed veneer, which requires special types of machinery, and two handmade methods for the manufacture of veneer using the external or internal part of the culm. This is rotary veneer, a type of bamboo used in the manufacture of non structural plybamboo and for overlaying inferior plywood with decorative purposes.

This veneer is peeled from round section of giant bamboos. Since the bamboo culm is hollow and the diameter and thickness of the wall decrease from the base to the top, it is only possible to manufacture bamboo rotary veneer from the sections of giant culms which include 1 to 3 internodes (about 50-60 cm long) with a minimum wall thickness of 10 mm.

These sections must be cut with a circular saw from the center part of the culm which has the longest internodes, leaving the two nodes at the opposite ends.The culm sections are boiled at 100 degrees C for about 3 hours to soften the material. According to Takeuchi (1968) this treatment produces a high quality veneer and decreases culms cracking.

After the sections are softened, the nodes at the opposite ends are removed and the cut is made at right angles. The final length of the section has to be the same as the lathe. Then they are fixed to a small rotary cutter which works at a speed of 30 to 40 rpm. Generally the veneer is 3-4 meters long, depending on the thickness of the culm wall. The bamboo is air dried or dried with hot air to about 12% moisture content. The pressing can be done in a cold or hot press.","Biobased, Process, Other naturals",Matte,0%,Closed,Smooth,Soft,Warm,Moderate,None,Poor,Moderate,Poor,Moderate,Light,Moderate,Yes
https://materialdistrict.com/material/banana-fibre-hemp-jute-carpet/,"Banana fibre, hemp & jute carpet",Other naturals,ONA660,Belgium,Bausol,"Bausol makes custom made rugs and carpets for boutiques, hotels and houses, made by the weavers of Nepal and North India and from all sorts of natural materials, like banana fibres, hemp and jute.

All varieties of banana plants have fibres in abundance. These fibres are obtained after the fruit is harvested and fall in the group of bast fibres. In Nepal, the trunk of the banana plant is harvested instead of the shoots. Small pieces of these trunks are put through a softening process for mechanical extraction of the fibres, which are then bleached and dried. The fibres obtained thus have appearance similar to silk and has become popular as banana silk fibre yarn. The fibres are refined, processed and skeined mostly by the Nepalese women.

Only the aged bark or the decaying outer layers of the banana plant are harvested and soaked in water to quicken the natural process. When all the chlorophyll, green pigments used in photosynthesis, is dissolved, only the cellulose fibres remain. They are extruded into pulp so that they may become suitable for spinning into yarn. The fibres have high textural quality similar to silk and as such employed in making high end rugs. These traditional rugs are woven by hand-knotted methods again by the women of Nepal.

The appearance of banana fibre is similar to that of bamboo fibre and ramie fibre, but its fineness and spinnability is better than the two. The chemical composition of banana fibre is cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The fibre is very strong and has a somewhat shiny appearance depending upon the extraction and spinning process. It is lightweight and has strong moisture absorption quality. It is biodegradable and has no negative effect on environment, thus can be categorized as eco-friendly fibre. Its average fineness is 2400 Nm and it can be spun through almost all the methods of spinning including ring spinning, open-end spinning, bast fibre spinning, and semi-worsted spinning among others.","Biobased, Lightweight, Sense & Sensibility, Other naturals",Matte,0%,Closed,Coarse,Resilient,Warm,Good,None,Moderate,Good,Poor,Good,Medium,Moderate,Yes
https://materialdistrict.com/material/banana-fibre-paper/,Banana fibre paper,Other naturals,ONA804,"Micronesia, Federated States Of",Green Banana Paper,"Banana fibre paper is made from agricultural waste left over after the banana harvest. The company extracts fibres from sustainably sourced banana trees grown at local farms here in Kosrae, Micronesia. In the paper making process, the fibres fuse together on a microscopic level to create a ‘leather-like’ paper material that is lightweight, tear-resistant, and biodegradable. It is important to note, however, that banana paper is less supple than leather, which may limit its role as a true leather replacement for shoes, handbags and other accessories.

Unlike apple, pear and other varieties of hardwood fruit-bearing trees, banana plants only fruit once in their lifetime and then they naturally die and decay away. The stem of the plant is what looks like the trunk of the ‘tree’, but it is actually tightly packed leaf sheaths that overlap as it grows. The most fascinating aspect though has to be the creeping underground stem and root system. It allows five or more generations of fruit-bearing banana stems to simultaneously grow at once.

The plant is categorized as a ‘tree-like perennial herb’ because the parent stem dies naturally after it bears the fruit and a new “sucker” takes over as the parent plant. This is sometimes hard to visualize, but this image shows the smaller offshoots already emerging from the soil waiting for their turn to bathe in the sun.

After farmers harvest the fruit, they chop down the parent stem to help facilitate this natural process and encourage growth, meaning that banana plantations are sitting on a gold mine of fibres otherwise considered waste material from the banana fruit harvest. Banana fibres are highly strong fibres that mix well with other fibres to form composites. They are lightweight, biodegradable, rapidly renewable, water-resistant, and flame-resistant.","Biobased, Biodegradable, Other naturals, banana, paper",Matte,0-50%,Closed,Smooth,Soft,Medium,Moderate,None,Moderate,Good,Poor,Moderate,Light,Poor,Yes

https://materialdistrict.com/material/barktex/,Barktex,Other naturals,ONA584,Germany,Bark Cloth,"Barktex is a bark cloth combined with the purely water-based acrylate resin. The Bark cloth is harvested from the permanently renewable bark of the East African “Mutuba” fig tree and produced in cooperation with small-scale organic Ugandan farmers. The bark is harvested once a year without felling the tree. Each strip of bark produces just one cloth, each with its own particular history. The shown contract chairs owe their stable yet flexible design to BASF’S innovative binding agent Acrodur, with which hemp, kenaf, sisal and decorative banana fibres are moulded into a structural part.

Not only is the cloth’s appearance multi-faceted, the applications for this unique Ugandan product are wide-ranging: Whether used as a wall covering, trade stand, furniture component or awning, it lends a unique character to every application.

Tree bark fleece from Uganda is reputed to be the most ancient textile in the history of mankind. Until the end of the 19th century the nest of these cloths were exclusively reserved for the monarchs of the nearly millennial kingdom of Buganda.

Acrodur opens up totally new design opportunities for processing and shaping natural fibre composites. It even allows three-dimensional objects, such as the ergonomic 3D shell of the atlanta 2.0 and the logochair swing, to be manufactured effciently and easily in an industrial production process. The resulting molded part also displays considerable mechanical strength. Consequently natural fibre composites produced with Acrodur are also ideally suited for use in the automotive industry where they provide lightweight solutions for door interior trims, parcel shelves or trunk floors, replacing far heavier metal or plastic components. Acrodur natural fibre components can be finished in various ways resulting in a natural, high-quality design and an attractive look.

Acrodur therefore contributes significantly towards sustainability, from the processing stage right up to the finished product. As a purely water-based acrylate resin, it does not release any organic substances such as phenol or formaldehyde. Furthermore shorter pressing cycles make for a more energy efficient production process. A sustainable alternative to conventional binding agents therefore which also highlights the excellent properties of natural fibres.","Biobased, Sustainable, Other naturals",Matte,0-50%,Closed,Smooth,Resilient,Warm,Good,None,Poor,Good,Poor,Poor,Light,Poor,Yes

The sizes are variable. The tiles with rough raster are used for laying into bed from wet concrete mix, or it may be glued by binding material similarly as ceramic tiles onto a prepared, properly cleaned, matured and compact concrete bed. The surface of basalt pavements is dust-free, it is easily maintained with common and mechanical cleaning means; this applies also for anti-slipping pavements, where the offsets are designed for easy cleaning.

The use of this raster is advantageous also for special adhesives and binders, e.g. in chemical operations, regarding the decreased consumption of the adhesive.

H – The smooth tiles are used very rarely and mainly for special purposes, where extreme minimum thickness and minimum consumption of the basement adhesive is required. As a standard, the raster tiles with R and JR grooves are produced. The products of melted basalt are, particularly on casting into the metal moulds, smooth, practically with zero imbition. For better adhesiveness to the binders, the non-working sides are fit with finer or rougher grooving, and additionally the sand is pressed into the surface during casting. The surface is roughened by individual sand grains, which are firmly bound to the basalt.

Adhesive capacity tests have proven that these „sanded” castings feature very good adhesiveness both to classic, and to modern synthetic binders.","Sense & Sensibility, Technology Transfer, Natural stones",Satin,0%,Closed,Variable,Hard,Cool,Moderate,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Heavy,Good,No

First the basalt is melted at a temperature of 1,400 °C (2550 °F). The molten rock is then extruded through small nozzles for the production of filaments of basalt fibers. The high modulus of elasticity of the product results in an excellent tensile strength, which is more than twice the tensile strength of steel.

Basalt Woven Textile has high corrosive and chemical resistance to the influence of a corrosive media: salt solutions, acid solutions and particularly alkali liquids. The specific strength of basalt fiber exceeds the strength of alloyed steel by a factor of 2,5 and the strength of glass fiber by a factor of 1,5. Heat-insulating items made from basalt fiber combined with inorganic binding agents may be used by temperatures up to 700°С. In addition there is a range of compositions consisting of basalt rocks that have a higher thermal stability – up to 800°С.

Basalt fibers also have high electric-insulating characteristics and transparency for electromagnetic radiation. These properties allow basalt fiber to be used for production of electric insulating materials for low-voltage (up to 250 V) and high-voltage (500 V) equipment.","Curious, Lightweight, Natural stones",Satin,0%,Closed,Smooth,Soft,Warm,Moderate,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Light,Good,No

https://materialdistrict.com/material/bauxite-residue-ceramics/,Bauxite Residue ceramics,Ceramics,CER263,Netherlands,Studio ThusThat,"Red Mud, a.k.a. bauxite residue, is a waste of the alumina industry. For every part of aluminium made, two and half times more red mud is also produced. The result is 150 million tonnes produced each year, and left unused in giant pits.

Working with factories and research labs, the industrial residue is transformed into ceramic bodies and glazes fit for architectural use.

Aluminium is not mined in its familiar metallic form. Rather surprisingly, its origins begin in a red stone, called bauxite. From this red ore, a white powder, ‘alumina’, is extracted, and then smelted into the metal we all know and interact with each day, including the very device you are reading this from.

This transformation of aluminium involves a global mechanism and system of extraction that operates at colossal scales and yet is nearly invisible to the everyday eye of its consumers. It is a system of extraction that exists to meet the demands of today. It is also vital to our future, given its recyclability, strength and lightweight nature. Often, this is at the cost of the locals from which it is mined. Ore is mined in countries like China, Brazil, Australia, Guinea and Jamaica, and shipped to refineries in the developed world, dissociating the final product from its material origins.

In the process of refining alumina, a red residue is left behind as a marker of these origins – a trace of the journey it has taken and a stark reminder of the costs, be it social, economic or environmental. This is red mud.

Red mud is presently left in hazardous landfills around the world, so large they can be seen from space. The global stockpile of red mud in these landfills exceeds 4 billion metric tonnes, growing by 150 million tonnes each year as our demands for aluminium continue to rise.","Recycling, Sustainable, Ceramics",Variable,0%,Closed,Variable,Hard,Medium,Moderate,None,Unknown,Good,Moderate,Good,Medium,Good,No

Natural fibers can be defined as substances produced by plants and animals that can be spun into filament, thread or rope and in a next step can be woven, knitted, matted or bound. The main reasons for the increasing popularity of biocomposites – or natural fibre composites (NFCs) – are the availability, consistent quality, variety and environmental friendliness of natural fibres.

The most viable structural fibres used in these architectural textiles typically derive from specifically grown textile plants and fruit trees. Natural fibres are subdivided into bast fibres (flax, hemp, jute and kenaf) and leaf fibres (sisal, pineapples and henequen), grass fibres (bamboo and miscanthus), straw fibres (corn and wheat), seed fibres (cotton and capok), wood fibres (pinewood), and fruit fibres (coconut).","Biobased, Other naturals",Matte,0-50%,Closed,Medium,Soft,Warm,Moderate,None,Moderate,Moderate,Moderate,Moderate,Light,Moderate,Yes

beLEAF™ is a revolutionary biomaterial that combines cutting-edge technology with a responsible and conscious mindset. Made from natural leaves of a plant called Elephant Ear (Alocasia Macrorrhisa), this biological tissue is surprisingly comfortable and resistant, and is an environmentally-friendly alternative to traditional materials.

beLEAF™ is made from leaves that are cultivated and collected in sustainable areas, grown alongside reforestation farms near the Nova Kaeru factory in Três Rios, Brazil. The process uses only resins and organic polymers of vegetable origin, and the residues are later composted and used as nutrients for the soil. The factory’s close proximity to the reforestation farms eliminates the need for long-distance transportation, reducing its carbon footprint. The water used in the transformation process is pH corrected and reused as irrigation for the reforestation farms, further reducing its environmental impact.

This innovative material helps preserve the soil, the biome, the wildlife and all natural resources, making it the perfect choice for those who are environmentally conscious. beLEAF™ is a vegan fabric with characteristics similar to leather, and does not use any animal origin chemicals in its process of transformation. This material truly is in balance with nature, from the biosphere back to the biosphere.

Global Green is committed to making a difference in the world by offering remarkable products with a unique and surprising aesthetic. With beLEAF™, the company has succeeded in creating a material that not only looks and feels great, but also helps preserve the environment and all its resources. Join the revolution and choose beLEAF™ for your next project.

Application

Characteristics The material has characteristics very similar to leather, with a notable difference that the CO2 emission of its manufacturing process is compensated by the carbon absorption of planting and leaf growth. beLEAF™ is one of the most sustainable options available today.

Unlike most other leather alternative products of vegetable origin, beLEAF™ is the leaf itself and is not created by mixing fibers and polymers, which maintains the beauty of the real leaf look, its texture, and its natural shape.

Size The choice of the “Elephant Ear” species was made by combining adaptation to the climate, rapid growth cycle, beauty and leaf size that can vary from 1’0 to 4’0 square feet.

Colours beLEAFTM is dyed with biodegradable organic inputs. Small color and visual pattern differences are expected and considered normal due to its organic tanning process, while respecting the individual characteristic of each leaf.","Biobased, Sense & Sensibility, Other naturals, leather alternative, vegan leather",Variable,0-50%,Closed,Smooth,Soft,Cool,Poor,None,Poor,Poor,Poor,Moderate,Light,Poor,Yes

Berriestex (berries/textile) is a vegan and sustainable material made from strawberries or other berries waste as overripe strawberries and their leaves stems and leaves.

The strawberries waste is mixed with different vegan and organic ingredients and becomes water resistent and durable through covering with a special plant oil-based liquid.

BERRIESTEX is 100% organic and sustainable. The finished material is flexible, sewable and is reminiscent of ostrich leather, due to the cores that can be seen in the finished material and impart a special structure.

The material can be used for the manufacture of unique, vegan luxury handbags or jewelry.

Now also available in black colour based on organic cotton, plant-based dyed so it looks even more like genuine leather.

Handmade in Berlin.

Open for collaboration.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/bese-elements/,BESE-elements®,Other naturals,ONA934,Netherlands,BESE B.V.,"Potato scraps have a new purpose at sea Dutch marine biologists recycle potato waste into mats that they use for nature restoration, like salt marshes, reefs and seagrass meadows. These Biodegradable Elements for Starting Ecosystems, or BESE-elements®, consist of stackable layers that build up into a biodegradable matrix structure. The modular design combines porosity with a complex structure. In a way it resembles the well-known building blocks: a clickable design with endless possibilities. Now, worldwide applications for nature restoration have been set up with the material.

The modules serve as a starting point: a temporary structure that provides adhesion, stability and protection for organisms, both plants and animals. After a while, nature can take over and the material can slowly break down.

The structure was awarded the first prize of the Circular Innovation Challenge (2018) and Jan Terlouw Innovation Price (2020).

Material properties The material consists of single layers, that are stackable for transport and can then be clicked together on site. The clicked layers form a complex 3-dimensional structure, with a large surface-area and many cavities. The renewable raw material, Solanyl, is biodegradable, carbon neutral and non-toxic.

Shape The material is designed for modular assembly and installation, allowing for different combinations, structure heights and dimensions depending on the needs (Fig 1). The basic element is a rectangle of approximately 0.455 x 0.922 meter. The number of layers and the shape are adjusted to the desired location, application or type of restoration needed. The color can be adjusted as desired with a biodegradable dye.

Biodegradable The material is made from Solanyl, a renewable raw material consisting of a mixture of biopolymers. An important component that has been used as raw material consists of potato residues from the French fry industry. The material complies with TUV OK Compost.","Biobased, Biodegradable, Ecology, Other naturals, marine life, nature restoration, potato",Satin,0%,Open,Smooth,Hard,Medium,Poor,None,Unknown,Poor,Moderate,Good,Light,Poor,Yes

These unique pieces, characteristically working with premium leather, are exquisite statements of intricate hand sculpting. Commissions range from small single panels to the imposing larger works covering entire walls. Her expertise in engraving and embossing leathers has been utilized in a series of bespoke leather wall tile projects.

Genevieve’s work is sought after by interior designers and private collectors globally. It is used in boutique hotels, private residences, restaurants and retail spaces of those looking for unique artwork installations. Genevieve works closely with a client to develop individual works on a commission basis. She is committed to the pursuit of exploring and cross pollenating intriguing pattern, luxury materials and innovative techniques to create exquisite, covetable and lasting pieces.

In a charming Victorian industrial space she has created a place where a dizzying and diverse array of influences converge. The ornate sculpted and embossed leather wallcoverings of 16th Century Europe are a strong inspiration. The intricate beauty of the carved wood panels of master craftsman Grinling Gibbons is a trace element in her work.

She is, however, no slave to uncompromised tradition. Her work is equally infusedwith a charge of Modernism. Bold geometry counters the filigree. She studies sculptural form and it’s response to light and shadow. Every project originates with a drawing. A pencil, later ink, on paper. Elementally simple, her line drawings are informed by, and express, a long love of Islamic tile, English Arts and Craft, Victorian lace and an almost infinite cull of influence.","Biobased, Sense & Sensibility, Other naturals",Matte,0%,Closed,Coarse,Resilient,Warm,Good,None,Poor,Moderate,Poor,Poor,Medium,Moderate,Yes

https://materialdistrict.com/material/bianni-wool-paper/,Bianni’ – Wool Paper,Other naturals,ONA1086,Mexico,Arudeko,"Bianni’ tells the story of an ancestral material, re-crafted to reveal the hidden value of discarded wool from the handmade carpet-making process. This project brings new life to wool that would otherwise be wasted, transforming it into a functional object that bridges the gap between tradition and innovation.

The wool used in Bianni’ is collected by a weaving community in Teotitlán del Valle, Oaxaca, a town renowned for its centuries-old tradition of weaving and dyeing textiles using natural dyes. The wool is repurposed from remnants of the carpet-making process, often discarded due to irregularity or perceived imperfections. Through this project, these fibres are celebrated, reimagined, and woven into a new form that honours the craftsmanship and knowledge passed down through generations.

As synthetic aniline dyes became more popular in the 19th century, the use of natural dyes began to decline, leading to the loss of valuable cultural practices. Bianni’ seeks to revive this ancient tradition, reintroducing the richness and authenticity of natural dyes that have faded from modern production methods.

This project is about more than just the wool; it’s about the stories embedded within the fibres. By working with local artisans, Arudeko aims to preserve the cultural heritage of Oaxaca, creating a product that is both functional and meaningful. The combination of two techniques in Bianni’ — one rooted in tradition and the other in innovation — tells a single story: the resilience, creativity, and wisdom passed down over centuries.","Biobased, Other naturals, paper, wool",Matte,50-100%,Closed,Variable,Hard,Warm,Moderate,None,Unknown,Unknown,Poor,Moderate,Light,Poor,Yes

Because microorganisms have the undesired effect of creating unpleasant smells, transmitting infectants and provoking material degradation, biocides have to be added to those textiles that are subject to the growth of microorganisms. However, this has to be done in a delicate balance, in respect of human and environmental safety while being effective against bacteria, algae and fungi. Biocidal products often contain substances of very high concern and have allergic, carcinogenic, neurotoxic or endocrine disruptive effects.

The Bio-AmiCoFitex coating is based on the application of natural resources. Antimicrobial coatings can be applied in sportswear, carpets, socks, bedding and upholstery, table linen, outdoor textiles, and other application areas.

There are various coatings available. Some examples are:

The biobased antimicrobials were applied by padding. During padding (also called foulard) a textile is impregnated with functional additives and a binder via immersion in a solution (often water-based). The solution contains a specific concentration of additives and binder. The concentration of these products depends of the desired effect and the wet pick-up of the textile. After the textile is immersed in the solution, the textile is squeezed between two rolls to remove the excess of solution.

On one hand, contemporary art stands for the new; on the other, it’s become an old and saturated place. Galleries aren’t investing in the sustainable creation of art or motivating the artists to push in this direction.

The project Bio Pigments atelier aims to change this paradigm. It is a project that revolves around creating your own paints and, in this case, a collection of paintings made with micro-algae pigments. The paintings were made using two distinct techniques. The first one is based on the beeswax technique, something designer Marius Melissas found while researching ancient Egyptian art. He found it fascinating how this technique, thousands of years old, is still perfectly applicable today, yet rarely used.

The second technique is based on using agar-agar, a component that is derived from algae. Making a bioplastic with it as a way of locking the pigments into the canvas. Using the agar-agar technique demands a lot of pre-mixing and setting up, once everything is in place to pour the medium, it must go fast because the bioplastic film forms quite quickly. This forces the artist to paint in an immediate, unhesitating, and intuitive manner, which corresponds exactly to what Melissas sought to create and the style of painting he enjoys. Since he had to proceed with a lot of trial and error, experimenting with all the combinations of pigments in their correctly proportioned quantities and carefully documenting them to achieve a functional paint, it felt very liberating for him to finally put the paints to artistic use.

The main goal was to make painting a regenerative practice, not something that uses finite resources as its building block. Artistic creation is said to be one of the most important things for humans, but we aren’t investing in making this specific practice natural. The practice can be expanded to a lot of new resources and mediums that are yet to be discovered as well. With Bio Pigments Atelier, Melissas intended to take a small first step in creating more awareness around this issue and bring change to the art of our own time.","Biobased, Coatings, pigments",Variable,0-50%,Closed,Medium,Hard,Medium,Poor,Moderate,Unknown,Unknown,Poor,Moderate,Light,Moderate,Yes

The process begins with 3D printing, powered by parametric design, which enables the creation of intricate, customized geometries that would be impossible to produce through traditional methods. The shape of the material can vary significantly, with moments of greater concavity or roughness carefully controlled and intensified through computational design. These variations are not merely aesthetic but functional, generating areas with diverse shadow and humidity levels that foster microclimates ideal for moss growth and expansion.

The use of natural clay offers several ecological benefits. It is inherently sustainable, can be recycled at the end of its lifecycle, and provides a tactile, organic aesthetic. Combined with moss, this material transforms walls into living systems. The moss enhances the surface’s environmental value by filtering air pollutants, improving air quality, and releasing oxygen. Additionally, it contributes to acoustic comfort by dampening sound and assists in regulating temperature by retaining humidity and reducing thermal fluctuations.

This material is designed for versatile applications as a wall finish for both interiors and exteriors. Its natural textures and dynamic greenery evoke a sense of harmony with nature, creating a calming and stress-reducing environment. The biophilic qualities of the moss, paired with the innovative use of recyclable clay, offer a perfect balance between technology and sustainability, making it an excellent choice for eco-conscious designs.

Basically any material that consists of fibres and a binding component (i.e. resin) can be called a composite. If both the fibres and the resin are extracted from biomass, it classifies as a biocomposite. Preferably residual waste is used to obtain raw materials.

One of the interesting biocomposites, the object of research at the CoEBBE, is called Nabasco. This is a composite that consists of a resin, a fibre and a filler. The ingredients can vary depending on the desired properties and esthetics. One of the possibilities is to use recycled toilet paper as cellulose fibres and chalk as a filler. Both materials can be obtained from wastewater treatment facilities.

Another interesting group of biocomposites are the mycelium composites. These materials consist of fibres that are held together by fungus hyphae. Basically the resin is replaced by a living organism. Mycelium composites have interesting thermal and acoustic insulation properties as well as flame retardant potential.","Biobased, Sustainable, Other naturals, biocomposites, composites, mycelium",Variable,0%,Closed,Variable,Resilient,Medium,Moderate,Moderate,Good,Moderate,Good,Moderate,Medium,Moderate,Yes

Fiberboards are widely used in the furniture industry and for internal house finishing. This new type of high‐density fiberboard is equally suitable for the production of free‐form furniture and partitions as well as slip‐resistant and shock absorbent floor‐ covering and –underlayment respectively. No formaldehyde and isocyanate components are applied, making it the ideal solution for different indoor applications.

The fiberboard consist of 80 % to 90 % straw, a natural fibre and residual material which is available worldwide. Therefore, the raw material’s price is very cheap and is not competing with food production. The fiberboards can be made of wheat, maize, rice, oat, barley or rye straw. In case of applying rice straw, the fiberboards have an extra advantage of having a silicate concentration of up to 20 % of the dry fibre weight.

Since silicate is a natural fire‐retardant material, the material classification “particularly fire‐resistant” according to the German DIN 4102‐B1 standard can be fully met through adding minimal mineral‐based flame retardant‐additives. An eco‐friendly thermoplastic elastomer is used as a binder. Accordingly, the board can be produced with no formaldehyde and isocycanate contents, thus minimizing the health risks during the product’s entire life cycle. At the end of its service life, the fibreboard may be also recycled or composted. This indicates that waste is hereby prevented twice: once during the production by using agricultural by‐products and the second time by composting the product at the end of its life‐cycle.","Ecology, Other naturals",Matte,0%,Closed,Medium,Resilient,Warm,Good,Moderate,Good,Moderate,,Moderate,Light,Moderate,Yes

https://materialdistrict.com/material/biofuel-waste-is-bliss/,Biofuel Waste is Bliss,Ceramics,CER278,Netherlands,Studio Agne,"The Biofuel Waste is Bliss project redefines the use of ashes from bioenergy waste streams, creating new environmentally-friendly materials and architectural products, such as ceramic glazing for tiles and bricks. Sourced from the Vilnius Heat Plant in Lithuania, approximately 460 tonnes of wood ash waste are generated monthly, posing disposal challenges. Globally, millions of tonnes of bioenergy ashes end up in landfills. By incorporating up to 55% ash content in ceramic glazes and clay bodies, the project aims to replace the need for newly extracted materials while reducing the industry’s CO2 footprint.

The Biofuel Waste is Bliss project collaborates with environmental scientist Marija Spokaite to ensure environmental performance. By working closely with the scientist, the project avoids greenwashing and substantiates its sustainable claims, addressing a common concern in design projects.

Globally, more than 476 million tonnes of ashes are generated from bio-based energy production, with a significant portion ending up in landfills. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the leading United Nations authority assessing climate science, recognises the significant potential of bioenergy in reducing greenhouse gas emissions when developed sustainably and used efficiently. As the world intensifies its efforts to combat climate change, the widespread adoption of biofuels is expected. Consequently, there is a growing need to find sustainable solutions for managing the increasing production of biomass ash, which is a byproduct of bioenergy generation. Vilnius Heat Plant, located in Lithuania utilises forestry residue as a primary source of biomass for energy production. Each month, the plant generates approximately 460 tonnes of wood ash waste, resulting in significant disposal costs. Currently, only a small portion of the waste is repurposed for road fillers, despite the non-toxic nature of the ashes, which makes them suitable for upcycling.

The ongoing Biofuel Waste is Bliss project research reveals that glazes and clay bodies can incorporate 55% or more ashes. Extensive research is exploring different aspects, such as incorporating waste in clay and glaze, applying it to various surfaces, and experimenting with different clays, firing temperatures, programs, and kiln types. Each modification requires specific chemical formulations. The incorporation of ash in ceramic glazes offers several benefits, making it an environmentally sustainable choice. Ash serves as a natural substitute for calcium, silicium, and other minerals found in wood ash waste, reducing the need for extracting these minerals from traditional sources. The melting oxides in the ash react during firing, creating a liquid phase that lowers the melting point of the clay and glaze. Furthermore, in the ceramic firing process, present minerals do not release CO2 as they have already been burned during the biofuel burning process. Additionally, the project utilises the natural iron content (approximately 2%) present in the ash as the sole source of colour for the Biofuel Waste is Bliss products. This eliminates the need for additional metal oxides, which can have negative environmental impacts.

Scaling up is a key aspect of the project, currently offering ceramic tiles in any desired quantity through skilled tile manufacturers upon request. The project repurposes biofuel ashes to create innovative, functional, and aesthetically pleasing ceramic solutions for interior and architectural applications.","Recycling, Sustainable, Ceramics, glaze",Variable,0%,Closed,Variable,Hard,Cool,Moderate,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Medium,Good,Yes

https://materialdistrict.com/material/building-integrated-photovoltaics/,Building-Integrated Photovoltaics,Glass,GLA251,Spain,Onyx Solar Energy S.L.,"Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) are photovoltaic materials that are used to replace conventional building materials in parts of the building envelope such as the roof, skylights, or facades. They are increasingly being incorporated into the construction of new buildings as a principal or ancillary source of electrical power, although existing buildings may be retrofitted with similar technology.

The advantage of integrated photovoltaics over more common non-integrated systems is that the initial cost can be offset by reducing the amount spent on building materials and labor that would normally be used to construct the part of the building that the BIPV modules replace. These advantages make BIPV one of the fastest growing segments of the photovoltaic industry, and it is becoming more and more a non visible aspect of the glass.

Thanks to this photovoltaic transparent glass, you will allow the transparency associated with glass and the transmission of sunlight, while avoiding UV radiation and infrared radiation. You can choose between a 10%, 20% or 30% of transparency degree, depending on the luminosity required.

The BurntWood Treatment Burning wood removes sugars and cellulose, preventing microbial decay and naturally preserving it. Used since the Viking Age and in Japan today, this technique extends wood lifespan to around 50 years without maintenance. A special primer prevents smearing, and the wood is CE-certified, fire-tested, and durable.

Innovative Use of Recycled Wood Traditional wood recycling is inefficient due to varying sizes and colours. BurntWood ReUse transforms these variations into facade elements, creating a unique architectural look.

CABBTEX (cabbage/textile) is a vegan and sustainable material made from cabbage leaves.

Cabbage leaves have been dried and refined with various water-based liquids, making them flexible, sewable and durable. CABBTEX is 100% organic and sustainable. In many supermarkets, there are often “scraps” laid out to take home, like the outer leaves of various types of cabbage, and even when preparing cabbage dishes, these leaves are usually removed because they are dry or not as beautiful.

Cabbage looks very special by itself with its special structure and thick veins in the leaves. Refined, dyed and preserved, these leaves are converted into unique beautiful handbags, accessories and jewelry.

Handmade in Berlin. Open for collaboration.

This cacao paper contains 10% cocoa shell content, which gives the paper a natural light brown colour and avoids the need for artificial dyes. The other 90% is predominantly made up of unbleached cellulose fibers from sustainable crops.

This bio-recycling solution was investigated by Barry Callebaut, a manufacturer of cocoa and chocolate products. He looked at how manufacturers could improve their environmental responsibility and enhance their waste recovery processes by reviewing their packaging. Incorporating waste cocoa shells into the paper-making process without the need for any additional processing was the result.

Currently this paper is in production and is certified for use in the food supply chain. One result of this innovation is that chocolate bars can now be wrapped in paper made from the waste materials of the used cocoa beans.",Other naturals,Matte,0%,Closed,Smooth,Soft,Warm,Poor,None,Poor,Moderate,Poor,Moderate,Light,Poor,Yes

https://materialdistrict.com/material/cameluxe/,Cameluxe,Other naturals,ONA839,Italy,Imbotex Lab Srl,"Pursuing a fully sustainable lifestyle is not always easy and more eco friendly clothing options than those proposed by the fast fashion industry are becoming more necessary than ever.

This can be achieved with a production cycle based on a Circular Economy model and upcycling is a big step forward in this direction. Upcycling is a neologism that keeps together two concepts that not always go hand-in-hand: first, the idea of recycling; and, second, the idea of improvement and quality (even though you are using discarded materials), thus the prefix “up”.

In a Circular Economy the aim is to create less waste by making the most out of every possible material and fabric involved in the production process. In Imbotex’s case, recovered scraps of camelhair fabrics are upcyled from the production of coats (and not only) in order to create a warm insulation. This pad is capable of maintaining the same properties of virgin materials, without requiring additional consumption. Imbotex’s particular form of insulation is named CAMELUXE®.

CAMELUXE® is created in three steps; firstly, recovered materials are gathered and sorted in Northern Italy; secondly, they are transformed through a mechanic process into very fine fibres; lastly, the fibres are blended with recycled polyester, creating a high performing insulating mix, ready to be processed to create the pad. This process, whose patent was filed, allowed us to create a product highly resilient, features extraordinary tensile and strength qualities and with consistent insulating capacity.

Made through a process that is less impactful in terms of energy consumption, waste production, water usage, CO2 emissions, CAMELUXE® is a new frontier for ecologically- responsible fashion, giving new purpose to otherwise discarded precious materials.

This project is carried forward under the aegis of the Global Recycling Standard, a certification promoted by Textile Exchange, an established non-profit institution, that for over 15 years has been supporting responsible and sustainable product development in the textile industry.","Biobased, Other naturals, insulation",Matte,50-100%,Open,Medium,Soft,Warm,Good,None,Moderate,Good,Good,Poor,Light,Moderate,Yes

https://materialdistrict.com/material/carbon-buster/,Carbon Buster,Concretes,CON095,United Kingdom,Lignacite Ltd,"The Carbon Buster is a new masonry block that is carbon negative. That means that the finished product, a brick usable for general building purposes, contains more carbon than is emitted during its production.

This has many advantages, primarily a high sustainability rating. The brick is produced by UK firm Lignacite and is affectionately known as the Carbon Buster. It is made using over 50% recycled aggregate. The rest of the brick’s volume consists of carbonated aggregate. This Accelerated Carbonation Technology (ACT) is a development by research firm Carbon8. Its density is under 1200 kg/m3. Their system uses CO2 during the clean-up of waste, contaminated matter and recycled building materials. By capturing the CO2 during treatment, the carbon footprint of the final product is reduced significantly. Waste material is mixed with water and then carbonated. The producers then combine the carbonated residue with recycled waste material, such as wood shavings, shells and glass.

The result is a brick that captures 14 kg more CO2 per tonne than is used to make it, leading to its carbon negative label. It acts as a carbon battery, and in the future the trick will be not to re-release the carbon when the brick is itself recycled. It can be used as new aggregate; the ACT matter can be used in bound applications, such as concrete. The producers are releasing the Carbon Buster later this year for use in projects.","Innovation, Concretes",Matte,0%,Closed,Coarse,Hard,Cool,Moderate,None,Unknown,Moderate,Good,Moderate,Medium,Moderate,Yes

During her research, designer Ekaterina Semenova explored the effects of different dairy products and waste when used as a glaze on ceramics, which makes the clay both more durable and waterproof.

Overproduction and continuous price drops have seen our appreciation of milk sink to an all-time low. With Care for Milk, Semenova wants to reclaim the value of this characteristic Dutch dairy product. Focusing on waste reduction, she collected leftovers from neighborhood households to experiment with new uses. Taking the advice from old Russian craftsmen, she applied it to ceramics. By dipping earthenware into different dairy products, various shades of silky brown appear after baking.

Depending on the type of milk – raw, low fat of high fat – different brown colours appear. The sugars in the milk caramelise during the process of baking and make the colours appear lighter or darker brown. The more sugars are in the milk, the darker the ceramics become. Combining this knowledge with different temperatures of baking, even more diversity of shades can be archived.","Biobased, Sustainable, Ceramics, glaze, milk",Variable,0-50%,Closed,Variable,Hard,Medium,Poor,None,Moderate,Good,Moderate,Moderate,Medium,Moderate,Yes

Anyone looking into the room from the outside sees just a black screen, while everyone inside the room can work with full privacy even with glass walls.

LED displays filter specific light oscillations. The light at the source oscillates in all directions. LED displays filter out all oscillations except the vertical. By filtering out the vertical oscillations, the cloaking technology renders the display light invisible. The film is applied to the glass on the inside of the room with the display. There is also graphic film available that can be mounted on the outside of the glass to customise the appearance of the space.

The material can be applied to any clear, smooth glass on new projects or existing glass. It is recommended for conference rooms, meeting rooms and team studios.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/cast-aluminium/,Cast Aluminium,Metals,MET222,Netherlands,Metaalgieterij Bruijs,"Aluminium can be casted in many desired forms. The casted aluminium can then be finished in four different ways: tumbling, blasting, brushing and polishing. Which kind of finishing is to be chosen first of all depends on the desired look. The blasted and tumbled finishes provide a more rough look, while polished and brushed finishes provide straightforward or design looks. The second important consideration in selecting the finishing should be the conditions in which the material is applied. A shiny look for a product that will be used outdoors seems to be best obtained by polishing, but due to the environmental influences the shine will disappear. Tumbling gives a more lasting result and will be an appropriate finishing technique. The MAS-hand has been produced based on a copy of a human hand. This copy was used in the casting-mould, made in sand. Seawater resistant aluminium has been used for production. The MAS-hand has been designed as a decoration for the façades of the Museum Aan de Stroom (Antwerp, Belgium. Designed by Neutelings Riedijk Architects) with tumbled finishing. The Metrobowl was first 3D drawn by designer Frederik Roijé. The fruit bowl designs have been inspired by maps of Amsterdam and Manhattan.

An amazing naturally hand dyed silk made with cocoons rejected by large silk industries, transforming them into precious treasures for interior and fashion designs.

Casulo Feliz was born by the idea of recycling, commitment to the environment, and social responsibility. Global Green works closely with the local community, entrepreneurs, and small farmers to develop processes that allow a healthy balance with the environment without generating CO2 emissions. The use of our fabrics and yarns have a negative carbon footprint calculation, making it a great ally for large companies aiming to offset their carbon pollution.

The cultivation of mulberry trees and the rearing of silkworms are naturally organic processes. Due to the silkworm’s extreme sensitivity, any chemicals used in the process result in the premature death of the larvae. The water used in both boiler and dyeing process goes through a water treatment station, making it completely purified and drinkable. Textile fibers and packaging are recycled at every stage of production, making the recycling process more efficient and resulting in minimal waste at the end.

Dyeing process The entire colouring and dyeing process is carried out using natural plants, without the use of heavy chemicals. In combination with Brazil’s rich biodiversity and the development of special techniques for botanical pigmentation, Global Green has managed to create 30 different colours. The process is alchemical, utilizing only water, heat, salt, and vinegar (acetic acid). The dyeing process is simple and artisanal, resulting in unique nuances of colour and transforming the product, satisfying customers who seek the exclusivity of natural materials. The most used dyes for our silk include: pine, eucalyptus, onion, mango, coffee, spinach, herbal teas, tanins, blackberry, pine, nut husks and seeds.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/ceramic-foam-filters/,Ceramic foam filters,Ceramics,CER229,Czech Republic,LANIK s.r.o.,"These ceramic foam filters are designed for mould-casting metal. Thanks to the mechanism of creation of the “filter cake” on the inlet filter side and thanks to depth filtration inside the ceramic matrix, these ceramic foam filters are an effective instrument to reach metallurgical purity of molten metal during the process of casting. The filters also calm mould filling, thus preventing creation of undesirable defects in the casting.

These filter features are conditioned by the open 3D structure of the ceramic matrix created by the system of mutually interconnected cells. They are characterised by a very good thermal conductivity, stability and resistance to sudden temperature changes.

Types of ceramic foam filters are conditioned in particular by requirements for their application. Filters for filtration of nonferrous metal alloys (casting temperature up to 1000 °C), filters for filtering cast iron with flaky and spheroidal graphite and filters intended for steel filtration are therefore used in practice.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/ceramic-textile/,Ceramic Textile,Ceramics,CER179,Spain,Flexbrick,"Ceramic textile is an innovative industrialized system based on an interwoven steel wire mesh, which is enclosed in a mosaic of ceramic clay tiles stacked in horizontal and vertical bands. The main advantage of ceramic textile is that it provides us with an ancient material in a new format that improves upon traditional manual installation, which is piece-by piece.

Produced by Flexbrick, ceramic textile can be used to “dress” façades, roofs, squares, and explore new relations with textile architecture. Applications in which this new ceramic textile has been used include drainable pavements, roof gardens, ceilings and suspended light-permeable façades. The applications demonstrate the architectural opportunities of ceramic materials when they are conceived in industrialized systems. Being highly flexible and easy to move, the textile can be folded onto pallets for storage and transportation, where it takes up little space. The long strips make its installation easy, quick and economical.

Installing a ceramic tile façade is similar to hanging a curtain: it merely requires stainless steel rails to be attached to the ceramic fabric in order to sustain it. The rails are bolted onto support brackets, which have previously been anchored to the facing slabs. In addition to the upper retaining anchors, several retaining anchors are installed to counteract the effect of the wind and to ensure the fabric is easily fixed in place.

In the case of lattices or light-permeable façades, the fabric is very light: 40 kg/m2 or less, depending on the number of gaps between the bricks. The meshes, the support rail and the retaining anchors are made of stainless steel in order to give the cladding system a long useful life and to avoid galvanic corrosion. Large-scale formats of up to 20 meters are possible, which saves a considerable amount of time and effort.

The system is very safe, as the installation of each retaining anchor involves weaving two adjacent sheets together, acting as a safety device in case of seismic activity. The tiles also feature an anti-fall device.

This interplay between visibility and concealment adds an interactive dimension to textiles, redefining their role in fashion and design.

Inspired by the functionality of traditional workwear and the need for adaptable materials, this textile innovation enhances both aesthetics and practicality. Collaborating with weaving engineers from the Swedish School of Textiles, the project integrates a dual-layered structure, allowing the outer surface to interact dynamically with its environment.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/chimera-shai-langen/,Chimera by Shai Langen,Other naturals,ONA453,Netherlands,Shai Langen,"Simultaneously organic and synthetic, the Chimera collection by Shai Langen is made from latex materials that have been transformed through the emulsifying reaction of latex and calcium nitrate. Malleable to the body and featuring detailed, fungi-like cellular structures, these materials offer unique inspiration for fashion/costume design, product design and interior architecture – to name just a few applications.

As a material, calcium nitrate is commonly used in the balloon, latex glove and condom industries to create a uniform film of latex around a mold. The molds are first dipped in both water and calcium nitrate before being dipping into liquid latex.

This material collection is the result of Langen experimenting with the shapes that form by dripping latex into the emulsion of water and by changing the viscosity of both the latex and the emulsion – resulting in some very different material outcomes.

Considerable experimentation was required to find the right production method for each original creation as the material itself is very sensitive to numerous factors, such as the ratio of calcium nitrate to water, the drying process, water surface tension, etc. Each piece of the collection demands a different thickness of latex as well as a different technique of dripping.

You can watch a stunning video of these materials and their sources of inspiration here .

Peel, also known as rind or skin, is the outer protective layer of a fruit or vegetable which can be peeled off. The almost white inner peels (the mesocarp or albedo) contain large amounts of pectin and are therefore also used for industrial pectin extraction. The pectin performs a firming and water-regulating function and contributes to the stabilization of the vegan leather. Its properties as a thickener, protective colloid and stabilizer are also used in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries to increase the viscosity and stability of emulsions and suspensions and to create various gels, creams and pastes.

Citrustex (citrus/textile) is a vegan and sustainable material made from tangerine peels or other citrus fruits waste.

The tangerine peels are mixed with different vegan and organic ingredients and becomes water resistent and durable through covering with a special plant oil-based liquids and plant based waxes.

CITRUSTEX is 100% organic and sustainable and and DOES NOT CONTAIN PLASTICS such as PVC or PU.

The finished material is flexible, sewable and has an interesting pattern in a yellowish-orange color.

The original clay plaster is made in the USA. It provides a durable, elegant finish for interior walls. The manufacturer, American Clay, offers a large range of colours and almost unlimited textures.

Clay plaster creates a healthy indoor climate due to the many natural properties. It naturally balances humidity. Mould, pollen and dust do not adhere to clay plaster, benefiting those with allergies.

The plaster also has a highly particular, clean appearance. It is strong and durable, as well as flexible, meaning it also does not tear easily. It stays clean and it does not attract dust. It is easy to repair and it eliminates the need to repaint year after year which makes it very cost-effective.

The manufacturers state that the clay plaster helps create a healthy environment by ‘buffering’ the effects of moisture in a room. Pores in the clay absorb moisture, and release it as the air dries out, say after showering in a bathroom. This continual exchange of moisture inhibits the growth of mould, toxins and pollens and reduces energy use. The plaster is relatively warm to the touch in winter and equally cool to the touch in summer.

Textile construction techniques are used to assemble ceramic particles. These structures are transformed to a flexible material, aiming to create new tactile, aesthetic and functional experiences of clay. The material behaves like fabric, but the ceramics add new architectural characteristics.

Claything uses various weaves to create the fabrics using clay beads made from different types of clay in various shapes, such as spheres or tubes. Depending on how the beads are woven, the resulting fabric is drapeable or stiff. A flat, square stitch with spherical beads, for instance, results in a stiff and dense textile that can be used to make 3D objects, while fabric made from tube-shaped beads using a right-angle weave forms a transformable light-filter.","Sense & Sensibility, Ceramics, clay, fabric, textile",Matte,0-50%,Open,Coarse,Hard,Cool,Moderate,None,Good,Good,Moderate,Moderate,Heavy,Moderate,No

From 2017 SCJ started looking into the possibilities of integrating waste materials in the glaze recipes, besides the already known custom of reusing leftover material from the production process. Since 2019 SCJ collaborates with ENS Clean Air Cuijk NL:

The glaze of Clean Air City Ceramics is composed with captured particulate matter from industrial working environments. At companies who care for their employee’s health, the working environment is cleared by the ENS air purification systems from harmful air pollution. An overall reduction in particulate matter and quartz concentration levels of more than 60% was measured. There is a visible improvement through the reduction of dirty air, dust and smog in factories.

Distinctive and sustainable and therefore a valuable addition to the palette of materials for the (interior)architect.

Clean-Air-City-Ceramics closes a loop. Harmful particulate matter that is captured directly from the polluted air in heavy industry is given a place in the production of glazes for architectural ceramics. This not only results in the elimination of health risks in an improved working environment, it also results in a circular building material. Residual waste from this major environmental problem becomes a special material with a purpose.

Here you can see an example of a tile made from 60% recycled materials and finished with a waste glaze from the Clean-Air-City-Ceramics series.

The Clean-Air-City-Ceramics series shows an infinite palette of possibilities and surprising factors that are a pleasure for the eye. “When public space becomes a living space, beauty is a very important factor.”

Custom designed ceramic glazes offer infinite possibilities for light reflection, absorption, textures and layering in the façades of buildings, interiors and the public realm. My designs aim to contribute to architecture that extends beyond the standard options and includes the possibilities of ceramics early in the design process.

Ceramics can be recycled over and over again without losing the quality of the material.

Citizens have an intrinsic relationship with their immediate living environment based on a number of values, in which sustainability and the concept of inclusivity have become prominent.

Architects and interior designers no longer focus solely on the physical exterior and interior, but are becoming increasingly relevant in the diverse places where people come together.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/cocoon/,Cocoon,Other naturals,ONA635,Germany,Eglo,"The silkworm, the larva of the silkworm moth, builds a cocoon for pupation from a filament that is up to 900 metres long. It is performing the heaviest work in the process as it needs to wrap itself with up to 300,000 loops. To get 250 g of silk thread in silk production, some 3,000 cocoons are needed, which is approximately equivalent to about 1 kg.

Eglo has taken this method as a model for the production of Cocoon luminaires. A unique special formula licensed by Eglo from which an extremely resilient and elastic material is produced. Models of any kind can be covered with a diaphragm. The variety of shapes allows almost infinite possibilities and only the sky is the limit in terms of designer creativity.

Process The filament is sprayed onto the rotating frame until it is fully covered with the first layer of filament. A few hours later, the ‘cocoon’ is ready for the second step of its transformation – the coating. For this, a special coating material is being applied to the woven frame that combines the filaments with the effect that the shade receives an extremely elastic skin. Now, the material is flexible enough that it will withstand being exposed to high levels of stress and is always able to regain its original form. Finally, the luminaire model will receive a special varnish layer. It protects the shade against soiling and can be cleaned using a wet cloth.","High-tech, Lightweight, Other naturals",Matte,50-100%,Open,Smooth,Soft,Warm,Good,None,Good,Moderate,Poor,Moderate,Light,Moderate,No
https://materialdistrict.com/material/cocoontec/,Cocoontec,Other naturals,ONA257,Switzerland,Weisbrod-Zürrer AG,"Cocoontec is a silk fabric, suitable for ties, scarves and other silk products. An extremely oleophobic (= oil repellent) surface finish is an advantage for silk ties, and for the material used in clothes for special occasions, so that soiling by various forms of food can be avoided. Conventional wet chemical finishes repel dirt by means of siloxane or fluorocarbon chemicals, partially combined with structural effects caused by nanoparticles. They affect the sheathing of the fibres, and the subsequent resinifying, whereby coating layers in the micrometer range are required. This affects the feel of the fabric. Collaboration with a chemicals company led to the development of a fluorocarbon chemical that provided the best oil repellence values, and was ideally suited to combination with silk. A special new pad-dyeing machine was developed in association with a machine manufacturer. This enabled the chemical coating process to be optimised such that extremely thin coatings of about 200 nanometres became possible. cocoontec® was introduced to the market on silk in the spring of 2008. The Weisbrod-Zürrer AG silk weaving mill was founded in 1825 and continues to produce fine materials for furnishings, women’s wear and men’s ties to this day.

PLA is a polymer obtained from renewable sources, has excellent mechanical properties and is biodegradable (it is degraded by the action of microorganisms). At the end of its life, this material can be incinerated (does not emit toxic gases), composted (used as fertilizer) and recycled. Due to the characteristics of the materials used, coffee composites have similar properties to MDF and may be machined by various techniques such as CNC, thereby acquiring numerous forms and geometric reliefs.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/coffee-polymer/,Coffee polymer,Other naturals,ONA820,Netherlands,OVPolymers,"OVDesigns offers a wide range of biobased high-performance polymer resins, which vary between biodegradable, compostable and non-degradable. OVDesigns offers materials for extrusion, injection moulding and rotation moulding.

The Coffee Polymer portfolio is an innovative material that uses 30% coffee grounds.

Espresso polymer OVDesigns has specially developed Espresso Polymer which is highly suitable for products that are intended to have a long lifespan, such as chairs, trays and coffee machine parts. Do you want to replace the product for something else? The material is fully recyclable and an industrial compostable. You can let your product be recycled to a new product or let it be degraded by industrial composting.

The Espresso polymer is a blend of coffee grounds and sugar canes. This carefully developed blend results in a very stiff material that can be processed in wall thicknesses from 1 to 10 millimetres.

The material can be processed by every injection moulding, rotation moulding or extrusion company. Since the material can be used in existing machinery, no extra investment is needed to buy new machinery. As the investment will be equal to the investments done by using standard polymers like ABS, PE, PS or PP.

Cappuccino polymer OVDesigns wanted to develop a polymer that was biodegradable but could also last a substantial amount of time. Therefore, OVDesigns developed the Cappuccino Polymer. This polymer can be used in the production of products like the packaging of cosmetics or cotton swabs. Normally these products are thrown away after use, which contributes to the growing amounts of plastics that end up in nature. When these products are made from the Cappuccino Polymer, they will degrade in nature in several months.

The Cappuccino Polymer is a blend of coffee grounds and corn starch. This carefully developed blend results in a degradable material that will last many years indoors but will degrade as soon as it is disposed in nature. The product can also be separated from other plastics, which means that the Cappuccino Polymer can even be recycled.

Americano polymer The Americano Polymer is specially developed for single use products. Products like these are planters and golf tees, for example. The Americano Polymer allows these products to degrade in approximately two months and gas nutritional value for the soil in which it degrades. Disposable planters don’t need to be removed anymore as they can be put in the ground and will offer nutrition for the plants.

The Americano Polymer is a blend of coffee grounds and potato starch. This carefully developed blend results in a degradable material that will last only a few months. When kept dry, the material will last for several years. This makes the material highly suitable to be used as protection during shipment and storage, but weak enough to degrade when the packaging is no longer needed.

The Americano Polymer can be used in injection moulding processes. The product can be used in a variety of products with wall thicknesses ranging from 0.7 to 10 millimetres.","Biobased, Biodegradable, Sustainable, Other naturals, bioplastic",Variable,0%,Closed,Variable,Hard,Medium,Moderate,None,Unknown,Moderate,Moderate,Moderate,Light,Moderate,Yes

The Coffee Tiles consist for 30% of coffee grounds and 67% recycled polymers. This combination gives the tiles a luxurious black marble effect and a hardness that mimics the feeling of a standard ceramic tile. The tiles can be fixed with standard tile glue and the seams can be filled with standard grout. To make the tile bathroom proof there is a top coat added on the tile that is fully recyclable with the complete tile.

At the end of life, the tiles can be taken off the wall without breaking. The removed tiles can directly be re-implemented in a new project and the broken tiles can be returned to OVPolymers to be fully recycled. The materials that are being used for the tiles are fully recyclable at the end of life. OVPolymers ensures that the materials will be recycled and implemented for new wall tiles or other products that are made from coffee polymers.

To match your interior the tiles can be delivered in every colour and pattern you can think of. The standard colour is the natural black marble tile.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/coffire/,Coffire,Ceramics,CER291,China,Studio KAE,"COFFIRE introduces an innovative porcelain surface finishing technique that uses spent coffee grounds as a sustainable colouring material, mimicking the textures of marble in a mass production setting.

Inspired by the ancient Chinese pit firing technique, this eco-conscious staining method takes place during a low-temperature firing process (600-800°C). At these temperatures, the biodiesel and sugars in the coffee grounds oxidise into a red pigment, which interacts with the ceramic surface to create organic, random textures. The final appearance is influenced by multiple factors, including temperature, humidity, and the density of the coffee grounds.

The COFFIRE project embraces an ‘imperfect’ design language, exploring the relationship between industrial standardised production and craftsmanship. Unlike traditional pit firing, which often relies on toxic metal-based colourants, this technique ensures product safety by using natural and sustainable materials. Additionally, COFFIRE replaces the traditional sand pit with a gas kiln, making mass production feasible while significantly reducing waste, a common issue in conventional pit firing methods.

A thin and very adhesive layer of titanium oxide forms on the component’s layer. The layer thickness can range between 200 and 900 nm and hence within a fraction of the wavelength of visible light. The light that strikes the surface is reflected by the colorless layer and the layer base. Interference caused by the layer (overlapping of the light rays) makes the layer look colored. Besides the color effect, titanium oxide layers offer good electric isolation and biocompatibility.

The best results with color anodizing are obtained with the TiAl6V4 alloy. The resulting colors are very lively, reproducible and of a good quality. Ti2 can be coated with a layer having a wide color spectrum. Compared to TiAl6V4, the color shifts vary within a range of blues and the colors are somewhat softer. Pure titanium can be color-anodized in a reproducible manner in blue and yellow only. This material is not suitable for decorative purposes.

Color-anodizing is especially used in the field of medical engineering: titanium implants that are left in the human body to heal bone fractures are color-anodized. This helps surgeons to quickly identify components. The coated implants have a neutral behavior in the body. They do not adhere to bones and tissues and they can be easily revealed after healing. Owing to their biocompatibility and decorative appearance, these layers are also used in the optics and jewelry industries, for instance, for watches or jewelry.

In the bicycle industry titanium ensures top resistance with a low weight. The color-anodized surface of wheel nuts can meet, for instance, the design required by buyers.

It interactively reacts to changing body or outside temperatures. Depending on the individual situation or activity level excess body heat is absorbed and restored until it is needed again.

The effect is based on millions of mPCM micro capsules: as soon as the body produces too much heat, the solid PCM will turn liquid and in doing so will absorb the heat, thus causing a cooling effect. Once the temperature drops again, the liquid mPCM will return to its solid state and release the stored heat back to the body. As the micro capsules are not subject to wear, their temperature control effect will be maintained over long periods of time. The material can contain varying amounts of PCM, depending on the application and the individual requirements.

The non-woven textile materials are made from high quality fibres and are breathable and lightweight. For winter applications, insulation features are added which improve the cold protection already provided by the PCM.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/common-sands-forite/,Common Sands – Forite,Glass,GLA293,Italy,"Studio Plastique, Snøhetta, Fornace Brioni","Although typically associated with beaches and playgrounds, sand is a resource essential to the continued functioning of our technology-driven society. Sand makes our electronic devices function, our homes light and warm, our communication fast (and ever faster) and our energy consumption more sustainable. Sand is integral to the production of silicon microchips, fiberoptic cables, insulation, and solar cells. Moreover, sand is the primary ingredient in glass, which is used in consumer electronic products such as fridges, microwaves, and computers.

Despite great efforts to extract, transport, refine and process sand into complex electronic components, little is done to recycle these components when electronic goods reach the end of their lives. They simply land in the dump. Glass has material properties excellent for recycling, but existing EU directives effectively process glass from electronic waste (E-Waste) do not exist. Sand is a finite resource, and as the volume of E-waste rapidly increases worldwide, we need strategies and solutions.

Based on a volume of existing research by Studio Plastique, Common Sands – Forite evolved as a collaborative research project between Studio Plastique and Snøhetta, with the aim of exploring the potential applications of recycled E-waste glass. Through many prototypes and variations, a process for recycling E-Waste glass components was developed, leading to the development of an application integrating and celebrating its variable material quality: glass tiles.

Italian ceramic tile manufacturer Fornace Brioni later joined the team, bringing their experience, industrial know-how, production facilities and potential for scalability to the project.

Made from recycled glass from microwave ovens, the tiles have been developed in two different sizes. The tiles are both opaque and transparent, each with a unique pattern and expression. With a deeply complex, terrazzo-like material quality, they are suitable for a wide range of architectural applications, including both surface coverage and as semi-transparent partition elements.

Common Sands – Forite positively leverages the unique properties of composition, colour, and structure inherent in the waste material into a series of architectural glass tiles. In an industry which demands transparency and consistency as a standard, Common Sands – Forite embraces the variance and complexity already embedded in the recycled materials. Focus has been set on waste glass from ovens and microwaves as a starting point to demonstrate the aesthetic depth, function, and potential of the recycled material, but does not limit the project to this material stream alone.

This collaboration with Studio Plastique, Snøhetta, and Fornace Brioni meets contemporary challenges with ambitious, pragmatic, and scalable solutions. Working across disciplines, organisations, and specializations, the project is an example of how collaboration and curiosity can contribute to creating significant changes within circular and sustainable design.","Recycling, Glass, tiles",Glossy,0-50%,Closed,Smooth,Hard,Cool,Poor,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Medium,Good,No

Rik Makes gives back what they take when it comes to fibres, and include nature’s decompositions quality’s when they researched their binder breaking down in nature.

The used binder is starch based. When decomposed the starch energises organisms and fungi, where the fibres are able to keep minerals and moist creating a hummus rich and living soil. This is a nature inclusive sheet material that has a function for both people and nature.

In the research of fibres, Rik Makes noticed the immense amounts of readily available chips from crop waste. Now burned or landfilled but potentially to be transformed to Compostboard. So they only use left-over streams of nearby agricultural landscape. Creating a opportunity to mass-consume sheet material without harm. As the amounts of chips are so big, there is the potential to build a production plant that can produce sheets for a price that can be purchased in a wide range of society.

Every agricultural landscape has its proud qualities. Most people know what is cultivated nearby and have or had roots in nearby cultivation. This creates a bond with a place and by using local waste we are able to strengthen that proudness. Showing unique aesthetics marking the quality of a place.

With the possibilities to create unique aesthetics, think about the lavender in France, or the tulips in The Netherlands, people can surround themselves with personal materials in their working or living environment. By having this bond with a material or product people are less eager to throw away products.

Next to that there is off course the quality of local production is the small amount of pollution coming from transportation cycles.

In the future when Compostboard is implemented in society the usage of chips gives another quality of including nature, it can put a limit to the current situation of infinite consumption of goods. The product has a seasonal limit, yearly there is a maximum amount of crops harvested in each local landscape. By using that waste we renew the idea of mass-consumption. And connect the behaviour of a consumer to seasons, harvests and local landscape.

The material is functional in interiors. When kept outside, in the rain or soil, the material decomposes, enriching the soil with fibres and starch.

It has a high wearing rating class (class 33) and contract fire classification. It is woven with Econyl, a 100% recycled polyamide yarn and features a new SBR-free backing. It is the first carpet backing containing no styrene-butadiene. Instead, the backing is a compound based completely on vinyl acetate ethylene (VAE).

VAE provides a number of advantages to the final product and is a solution for those who are environmentally conscious.

Advantage of this new backing include an absence of odour as using VAE ensures that the characteristic odour of new carpets is now a thing of the past. This backing further offers reduced flammability as tests on films of carpet backing compounds with VAE and SBR showed the VAE films to be far less flammable thant he SBR films. The new SBR-free backing is therefore ideal in commercial locations such as hotels, offices, shops, etc., where fire safety is a high priority.

Finally, lower emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are used to manufacture and maintain building materials, interior furnishings and cleaning and personal care products. These carbon based chemicals evaporate into the air, often in indoor environments. The German Textiles & Flooring Institute GmbH tested both VAE and SBR carpet backings for emissions of VOCs.

When ores are mined, or when secondary sources of metals are recycled, the input is smelted at high temperatures to extract the metal. The molten impurities leftover from this process is slag, a black, glassy rock that closely resembled volcanic stone.

Slag is produced regardless if the metal is made from mining or recycling. As such, slag is an inevitability of our future, and has been amassing in mountainous heaps for centuries; industrial-era slag heaps are still common to the European landscape.

Given the thermal process it has undergone, slag benefits from unique properties, and can be used as an alternative to cement — a ‘geopolymer’ – with up to 80% lower CO2 footprint.

The slag-geopolymer benefits from high thermal resistance, high durability and strength, corrosion resistance, partial recyclability, all the while being made from a waste.

Coremat as a core material is used in the center of a laminate. Coremat can replace much heavier solid glass layers. Impregnated Coremat has a density of 610 kg/m3 (38 lb/ft2), while Impregnated Chopped Strand Mat has a density of 1,500 kg/m3 (94 lb/ft3). This is a weight saving of 60%.

Coremat saves resin and glass; Coremat contains less resin than CSM: 1 mm (0.039 inch) of Coremat contains 0.6 kg/m2 (2.0 oz/ft2) while 1 mm (0.039 inch) of CSM contains 1 kg/m2 (3.31 oz/ft2).",Plastics,Satin,0-50%,Closed,Smooth,Resilient,Warm,Good,None,Good,Good,Good,Moderate,Light,Good,No

Cork as a wall covering: Besides being decorative, cork coverings are also functional. Available in a variety of sizes and thicknesses, these decorative coverings can also serve as tack and pin boards without damage to the cork, making this material ideal for offices and children’s rooms. Cork is a natural insulator – in terms of both temperature and acoustics.

Cork floor: The cork patterns that you see on a cork floor come directly from the grain pattern of the veneer. Just like the grain of oak is different from maple or walnut, so too are there different grain patterns of cork. These veneer patterns appear on the top layer of most cork floors. The bark of the cork oak tree was designed by Mother Nature specifically to protect the tree during its lifespan. Not only is the bark inherently fire retardant to protect the tree from forest fires, but it’s also resistant to extreme temperature changes prevailing in those regions, as well as resistant to more than 38 species of insects including the termite, and to the development of microbes.

Cork comes from the bark of the cork oak tree, which grows in the forests of Mediterranean countries. It’s truly one of nature’s miracle products, renewing itself over and over again. The largest concentration of plantations are found in Spain and Portugal, which were founded by the wine industry centuries ago. After 25-30 years, a new cork tree develops a thick bark that is about 2″ thick. Skilled farmers with special tools carefully peel off about ½ of the bark. This does not hurt the tree; the bark grows back within 8-12 years and the process begins all over. (One cork oak tree yields 50 harvests over its useful life of 300-500 years. That supplies thousands of cork floors. By comparison, most hardwood flooring requires not only killing the tree, but the tree itself only results in a few floors).

To process cork, the bark is cut into large uniform sheets 4′-5′ long x 2′-3′ wide. They’re carefully transported to a mill where thin layers are veneered off the surface. The layers are the most dense right beneath the outer bark layers, while the inner layers are softer and less dense.

The properties of cork are derived naturally from the structure and chemical composition of the inner cells. For example, each cubic centimeter of cork’s honeycomb structure contains between 30 and 40 million cells. It’s this unique cellular structure that gives cork its innate characteristics, and each of these cells contains suberin, a waxy substance that gives cork its resistance to insects, mold and mildew.",Other naturals,Matte,0%,Closed,Variable,Soft,Warm,Good,None,Good,Good,Moderate,Good,Light,Moderate,Yes

https://materialdistrict.com/material/cornwall/,CornWall,Other naturals,ONA1049,Netherlands,FRONT® Materials,"CornWall is a wall finishing material crafted from plant-based biomass. It is sourced primarily from the cores of regional (Western Europe) corn cobs. This organic waste is widely available and usually destined for fermentation, burning as biomass or remaining on the field. CornWall is an alternative for ceramic wall cladding or other less sustainable composite materials such as HPL.

As the CO₂, absorbed by the biomass of the corn cobs during growth, is not naturally broken down or burned and thus retained for longer, CornWall stores more CO₂ than is emitted during production. Since the product is biodegradable or can be 100% reused, there is also no end-of-life waste. CornWall will be supplied with a demountable anchoring system and is not glued. It can thus be removed from the interior if needed.

CornWall® is produced in a sheltered workshop in Antwerp, Belgium. Circular Matters utilises a pressing process to create the products. By heating organic material up to 150 degrees Celsius, the polymers in the biomass activate and form strong bonds, which results in a strong and stable end product. This heating process is electrical, powered by sustainable energy, mainly from solar panels on the roof of the production facility. The production process requires no fossil fuels.

In the future, StoneCycling intends to set up a recycling scheme, enabling the return of end-of-life products. These tiles can then be ground and converted 100% into a new product.

The company will start producing the CornWall base collection – under the creative and strategic direction of Studio Nina van Bart – with one texture, eight colours and two sizes.

Inside the box is an auger that turns slowly and causes pressure against a slotted screen that separates the solids from the liquids.

Solids are forced out the end while the liquids are pumped into the holding lagoon. The solids are used to make the compost used for the Cowpots. The temperature of the poo is kept at 103 degrees and the process seems to replicate a cow’s digestive system. The whole operation is like a “mechanical butthole”. Water and other ingredients are added in a mixer. The pots are then moulded and put on a rack in an oven to dry.","Biobased, Biodegradable, Other naturals, gardening, landscape, urban",Matte,0%,Closed,Coarse,Resilient,Warm,Good,Strong,Unknown,Poor,Poor,Poor,Light,Poor,Yes

Low-maintenance, easy to recycle, durable, and elegant. Copper complements glass, metal, stone, wood and brick: about any construction material. Creative Copper by Luvata’s Nordic Systems can be used in outdoor and indoor situations.

Nordic Products are the result of Luvata’s patented industrial processes that allow prepatination of copper sheet from coil at the mill. No chemicals are used to achieve the green colour of the sheets. Maximum width is 1000mm, thicknesses between 0,50 and 1,50mm. Luvata’s production method enables usage of prepatinated copper on coil which provides longer sheets, up to 14 meter. For example in roofs this requires fewer seams and gives a more durable final result. Several finishes of the surface are possible:

Standard: Under natural conditions, it takes years for high-grade copper to acquire a chestnut brown. It takes several years to develop a highly textured, green surface. In this natural state, it never needs servicing or re-treatment.

Nordic Brown: Thanks to its patented process, Luvata can achieve a dark oxidized surface equivalent to natural oxidation before the green patina is expressed. The chestnut brown surface may be allowed to remain, or, when a postpatinated surface is required it can be the basis for the Nordic Green process.

Nordic Green Plus: prepatinated copper which has a green patinated surface comparable to naturally weathered patina. This material offers an immediate green surface in coils or as sheet. Different surfaces are available: Traditional Green and Living Surfaces.

Nordic Decor: Structure-rolled Nordic Decor offers an attractive, versatile alternative to smooth copper surfaces.

By transforming non-recyclable crisp packets into serving bowls that hold crisps once again, Crispy showcases the potential of recycling complex plastics and circular design.

Due to the high salt and oil content in crisps, the crisp packaging requires a high-tech multilayered polymer structure that is difficult to recycle and is not currently accepted in home recycling. Instead, this type of packaging is often incinerated, landfilled, or littered. In today’s conscientious era, where the push is to minimise single-use plastics or increase recycling, this particular type of packaging tends to be overlooked or its underlying issues remain largely unnoticed.

Crispy addresses these challenges by salvaging difficult-to-recycle plastic packaging and recycling each material separately. Through a specialised separation process, each crisp packet is delaminated into four distinct materials: two PP films, a metallic PET film, and ink. The delamination process ensures that all the plastics used in the packaging retain their quality and therefore can continue to be recycled. This transformation not only prevents these packets from becoming environmental hazards but also demonstrates the potential for recycling this type of unreclaimed plastic.","Recycling, Plastics",Variable,50-100%,Closed,Smooth,Hard,Medium,Moderate,None,Unknown,Unknown,Moderate,Moderate,Light,Good,No

The narrative of the Cumbrian Bone Marble is based on the 2001 Foot and Mouth Disease episode. Cumbria was the most affected region in UK and to avoid the propagation of the virus, million of animals were incinerated and buried in pits. This scenario speculates that the geological processes exerted to this pile of bones would produce the Cumbrian Bone Marble, that could become a valuable resource mined in the future.

Yesenia Thibault Picazo manufactures minerals out of the materials most often used by humans. Aluminum, bones and plastics are employed to create a ‘material library out of future geology’. The resulting collection consists of intriguing rocks that Thibault-Picazo refers to as PPC (Pacific Plastic Crust), Cumbrian bone marble and Aluminum nuggets. The Anthropocene era is a new geological epoch evidencing the impact of global civilisation on Earth. The term was coined a decade ago by Paul Crutzen and suggests that humankind has become over time a global geophysical force intertwined with the most powerful forces of nature. Through the collective actions, we spread specific elements in nature, rare in the pre-human era, which will become prevalent sediments, building up the future planetary strata. Observing this shift, Yesenia catalysed the slow geological phenomenon to manufacture human-made minerals out of the most distinctive materials of our epoch (aluminium, bones, plastics).

Advantages are:

– Weight saving: nearly 50% of weight is saved when comparing Curv to glass reinforced materials. – Environmental friendly: being 100% propylene, Curv is easily recyclable, both as factory waste and as consumer parts. – No irritation: because of the lack of glass fibres, Curv is skin friendly and easy to handle. Additional coating is not required – Thermoformable: Curv’s thermoforming characteristics enable parts to be produced using low pressure, low cost tooling at modest temperatures.

Curv is applicable in for example the automotive industry, for sports equipment and for travel gear. The lowest picture shows a composite of foam with Curv outer layers.",Plastics,Satin,0%,Open,Smooth,Hard,Medium,Moderate,None,Unknown,Good,Good,Good,Light,Good,No

Made from stainless steel, copper, or brass, it is hand-crafted on industrial looms and custom-made to order. For interiors, mesh is most often used as a wall or ceiling covering or as cladding in elevators. However, because of its versatility, metal fabric can clad almost any surface, or stand alone as a space divider. For exteriors, mesh is most often used for building facades. Metal fabric has the ability to shield windows and openings while still providing views and airflow if necessary. Recently, mesh has been developed as a shading material, reducing solar heat gain and optimizing day lighting inside high-performance buildings. The last two designs engineered for curved architectural mesh systems are one that adapts to Cambridge’s Eclipse™ attachment to precisely match and effectively hold flowing mesh panels, and the other attaches flexible mesh to a custom-designed curved steel framework.

The form, finish, reflectiveness and colour of the metal components can all be defined by the client. The fabrication processes are then designed to match these . Different effects can be produced within the same series of products. Embossed patterns, for example, can vary from one panel to the next, the overall design emerging only when all the individual panels are fitted together. Intricate perforated patterns can combine to form a sophisticated decorative design, and selective colour shading on metal mesh can create impressive design effects. The starting material is generally stainless steel, in the form of thin sheets with a matt, reflecting or milled surface. Some production modules can handle panel sizes of up to 2000 x 6000 mm. Options for surface finishes include pickled and electropolished, ground, brushed, bead-blasted and mechanically polished, electrolytically coloured (interference colours) or coloured by means of vapour deposition. These finishes can be directional or non-directional, covering the entire surface or only selected areas. Engraving and forming is carried out on CNC machines. Embossed designs can be applied as dots or lines or impressed on larger areas. Shapes are produced by deep drawing using flexible interchangeable modular presses.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/customised-composites/,3D printed customised composites,Plastics,PLA1187,Netherlands,Fiberneering,"Fiberneering is a manufacturer of 3D printed fibre reinforced composite parts. They create customised strong and lightweight products in almost any shape. The company offers freedom in design, and possibilities for structural applications as well as prototypes. Because they do not make use of moulds, the production of the final product can start immediately, saving time and material. Fully functional carbon or glass fibre reinforced parts can be produced in almost any shape or form.

Using FRP3D technology, the company produces composite parts. These parts consist of carbon, glass or any other type of reinforcement in most common resin types. Because standard materials are used, the properties they obtain are as high as “traditional” composites and Fibereering can fully engineer the products to suit the application. More complex shapes can be made, fully optimised in a very cost effective way.

Sandwich cores are used in numerous applications. The advantages of honeycomb, foam or balsa cores are well known to industry: extremely high stiffness at very low mass. However, the costs of producing sandwich products in anything else than flat plate are very high. Generally, choosing a sandwich core material is a trade-off between density, shear and through thickness properties and processing. With printed cores, this selection process is history; optimise the core to the application!

Firstly, processing is no longer required. Usually, core materials are milled, thermoformed or pressed into the right shape. All these processes are expensive and require expensive machines or tooling. Here, the core is directly printed into the required shape. The skins on the core are printed as well, so they are extremely suitable for use in the patented co-curing technology.

Secondly, by changing the orientation, amount and thickness of the reinforcing trusses inside the core, the shear and through thickness properties of the core can be fully optimised.

And lastly, functions can be integrated. Any cable ducts, sensors, reservoirs, etc., can be printed at once and don’t need to be drilled or fastened afterwards. This again is an efficiency improvement compared to other sandwich construction.The internal structure can be modified and optimised to ensure maximum part performance: where loads are high a more dense internal structure is used and where loads are low, internal mass can be minimised.","Process, Plastics, 3D printing, additive manufacturing",Variable,0-50%,Open,Variable,Hard,Medium,Poor,None,Moderate,Good,Moderate,Good,Light,Moderate,No

The weaving of fabric inherently creates tons of blended surplus called selvedges or loom tapes during the industrial weaving process. Used to secure both edges of the main fabric, the selvedges are trimmed on the loom directly. When recycling is not an option, Cutting-Edge offers an alternative for material re-generation to avoid incineration of valuable materials (merino wool, cashmere, silk).

To process the selvedges to the scale of the waste, Jane Wright developed a machine attached to the loom, able to simultaneously wind the selvedges and create new textile while the main fabric is woven. The making process is designed to select and generate evolving combinations of colours and textures using the waste available.

The result of the process is a textile mat that plays with the functionality of textile upholstery and present versatile uses as a seat cover.","Recycling, Sustainable, Other naturals, carpet, furniture, soft floors, upholstery",Matte,0%,Closed,Medium,Soft,Warm,Good,None,Unknown,Unknown,,Good,Medium,,Yes

On top of those functional qualities, Cyclin® panels are 100% circular and based on cellulose fibres derived from paper waste streams (biobased). The production process generates no waste, and leftover pieces, including those returned by customers, are recycled to create new panels. Due to significantly lower energy consumption compared to traditional insulation materials, Cyclin® has negligible nitrogen, ammonia, and CO2 emissions. In fact, Cyclin® material sequesters 1 kg of CO2 per kg of material, and the utilization of waste streams as raw materials eliminates the need to cultivate, cut, harvest, or mine new resources. This approach aids customers in achieving the climate goals set for 2030 and 2050.

The Cyclin® Life Cycle Analysis shows an environmental costs indicator (MKI) of only € 0.055 and a Global Warming Potential of only 0.5 kg CO2-equivalents per kg Cyclin. Take into consideration that Cyclin stores approximately 1 kg CO2 per kg material and we conclude Cyclin to have CO2-negative footprint.

Cyclin® is committed to sustainability not only through the reuse of materials but also by minimising its environmental impact. The insulation panels not only contribute to energy efficiency and a reduced carbon footprint but also actively participate in carbon sequestration. By incorporating customer returns and avoiding the need for new raw materials, Cyclin® aligns with circular economy principles, emphasizing the importance of resource conservation and waste reduction.

The properties of Cyclin® panels, combining acoustic excellence, subsequent additional thermal insulation, and moisture regulation, make them a versatile and environmentally friendly choice for various applications. Whether applied in residential, commercial, or industrial settings, Cyclin® insulation panels support a healthier and more sustainable indoor environment.","Acoustic, Other naturals, cellulose, thermal insulation",Matte,0%,Open,Coarse,Soft,Warm,Good,None,Moderate,Unknown,Poor,Poor,Light,Moderate,Yes

Derbinite NT is a membrane which is manufactured from a patented bitumen-polymer matrix, making the material fully waterproof. The acrylic coating ensures optimum adhesion for more than 20 years between the membrane and photovoltaic modules with a guaranteed lifetime of 30 years. The material is perfect for new installations on existing roofs and for projects which need a discreet integration into their surroundings. The benefits: It integrates perfectly into the roofing and is invisible from the ground, even on curved surfaces. The material is placed flat on the roof; it casts no shadows and the wind has almost no effect. The material is almost indestructible; the cells are enclosed by plastic, not glass, thus making it durable and reliable. The material is less sensitive to shading: Bypass diodes in each cell can balance the production of the panel when it is partially shaded. The material requires no perforation or extra ballast because there is no metal structure used for the placement.

For the purpose of fire certification, however, the above mentioned distinction is not decisive, because the decorative component does not affect the results of the response to fire test. With regard to response to fire, therefore, the Serie Metalli range is comparable in all aspects with other products of the ABET range.

The bricks are manufactured and used in sustainable construction projects in Utrecht, such as the Merwedekanaalzone and Cartesiusdriehoek. This way, the residual material from a historical monument is used for future, sustainable buildings.

The Utrecht Dom Tower will be restored between 2020 and 2024. All material that comes from the tower is reused as much as possible. Bokkenmákers and New Horizon, in collaboration with brick manufacturer Wienerberger, took the initiative to manufacture a special circular brick from rubble and grit from the Dom Tower. The Domsteen contributes to the prevention of demolition waste and the waste of useful building materials. Part of the proceeds will also benefit a light artwork on the tower.

THE DOMSTEEN: SUSTAINABLE FROM START TO END New Horizon has processed the rubble of the Dom Tower and makes it suitable for use in the Domsteen. Dutch river clay is used as the basic raw material for the stone: a sustainable material that is infinitely and locally available. The residual material from the Dom is added to the brick as a raw material. This composition guarantees a long life, with all the functional and aesthetic properties of a brick. The Domsteen is available in different colours and consideration has also been given to the end of the Domsteen after its lifespan: the circular bricks can be selectively demolished, processed and reused as a material. That completes the circular circle again.","Recycling, Ceramics, bricks",Variable,0%,Closed,Variable,Hard,Cool,Poor,None,Unknown,Good,Good,Good,Heavy,Moderate,No

Encapsulation is the containment of various substances within a coating or membrane. This mini container of just 3 to 8 microns, made from melamine resin, protects the fragrance from dehydration, oxidation and contamination, which explains the durability throughout the lifespan of the product. The encapsulation technique ensures that instead of being released all at once, the fragrances are released gradually upon contact or gentle rubbing. This steady and controlled release process prolongs the effect and prevents an overdose of the encapsulated products. The fragrances are thereby released in exact doses, never in excess. This fragrance release can only be triggered by stimulation: this means by rubbing, not by pressure alone.

Zoontjens has collaborated with the Dutch designer Baukje Trenning, for its first series in the DreenDesign Collection. She motivates her designs as “I draw with light; the shades caused by the relief change with every moment of the day and every season, creating different images all the time.”

As a designer of architectural surfaces, Baukje Trenning has been designing rhythms for buildings and exterior spaces. This ‘skin’ should stimulate observation and add an extra dimension to space. She uses relief and repetition of elements on both macro and micro levels. When she designed the DreenDesign collection, Baukje Trenning Baukje chose to use highly graphic patterns. The production technology of Zoontjens Beton enabled her to have a complete control over patterns which produce exact prints of the mould. Trennings patterns come from the world of fabrics – not so much prints, but three-dimensional patterns that have volume, like corduroy or knotted tapestry. The collection includes neutral patterns as well as several highly pronounced designs. These designs enhance the character of the different functions of the public space.

The photos are showing from top downwards: Binary Fields : a neutral slab with interrupted and staggered stripes. In close-up the slabs look busy and full. From a distance, however, they look really smooth. Visually, they suit all types of environments. With its narrow notches, this slab is sensitive to point-load pressure from market stalls and similar.

Smooth Waves : a 2 x 2 m floor plate incorporating two designs. Smooth Waves has waving grooves in one direction and crossing lines. By laying them in a certain pattern, it is possible to create an interweaving of lines around e.g. trees and lampposts. A certain angle of light creates the optical impression of billowing plates.

Streamlined Scratches : a 60 x 60 cm slab that was originally design for roof paving. The grooves – scratches – are at random distances from one another and diagonally staggered. The staggered pattern literally seems to create a floating movement.

Floating Pebbles : a pattern consisting of three spots of various dimensions that bleed from one slab to the other. These spots have shapes somewhere between geometric and amorphous. People see them as stylised leaves, footsteps, cobbles or pebbles. After a rain shower the spots seem polished and look like mirrors.

Ltd,"Untill the Olympics in Seoul 1988, rubber was the material mostly used for the soles of (sport) shoes. During the Olympics a new material was introduced which was lightweight and provided much better grip than rubber, even when used on a wet surface. This resulted in better performance and therefore the material became a popular choice for top runners. However, this material and its manufacturing technology were immature enough to be widely used by the general public. Geltec Co. Ltd introduced a new patented process for the mass production of the Dual Stencil Process (DSP) material, which makes it affordable to everyone.

DSP is a new generation textile with polyurethane-based projections. With the technology, the characteristics of an ordinary textile can be greatly improved.

DSP has been gradually replacing rubber sole on the athletic shoes, primarily due to design flexibility/possibilities, functional features in traction, lightweight, and anti-abrasion. It is also used on gloves and the kneepads on wet suits, as well. Besides shoes, DSP is on its way to identifying a lot of potential in other applications such as bags, accessories, stationeries, barrier-free items to prevent slippery, house ware, apparel, packing material, etc.

DSP offers great design flexibility due to the many combinations possible based on the choice of base textile (material and colour) and tailored polyurethane projections (shape and colour). The pattern can be made up of a single or multiple, isolated, independent projections.

Due to the use of much lighter base textile and isolated, independent projections, DSP is extremely lightweight and flexible, about half the weight of rubber-made sole. As mentioned earlier the anti-abrasion performance is exemplified in the use of athletic shoes.

Polyurethane-based projections, shaped out of the mold (s), could flexibly take a variety of patterns according to your design, but Geltec has a series of ready-made projections that are produced out of their own open molds shown below. Also, the projections could be coloured, placed on one layer or on two layers. The base textile could range from regular textile to synthetic leather, neoprene, Jersey, etc as long as it allows melted polyurethane to penetrate.","Innovation, Plastics",Satin,0%,Closed,Coarse,Resilient,Warm,Moderate,None,Unknown,Good,Good,Good,Light,Moderate,No

Highly resistant to bending, its great flexural strength means it can withstand significant transformations without breaking. Ductal also comes with organic fibers for applications with less load and for architectonic applications. Resistant to external stresses, such as abrasion, pollution, bad weather, and scratching. Constructions made with Ductal resist abrasion as well as the best natural rock, such as granite. These properties provide Ductal with durability, guaranteeing less maintenance throughout the lifetime of the structures. Self-healing, Ductal is durable and highly resistant to abrasion, corrosion and freeze-thaw. In contrast to traditional concrete, the pores are smaller and discontinuous. Smaller pores make the material more resistant to penetration by salt, moisture and chemicals. If it gets in, fluids can’t join networks of pores for long-term pooling. It also has a “self-healing” feature. If water manages to penetrate the surface it combines with unhydrated cement, reactivating the hydration process and pretty much acting as its own internal sealer.",Concretes,Matte,0%,Closed,Smooth,Resilient,Cool,Poor,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Medium,Good,No

The laminates of these lightweight panels are finished with peel ply to protect them from contamination and to reduce preparation of the surface prior to secondary bonding or laminating.

DuFLEX Composite Panels are manufactured under controlled temperature and humidity conditions, and products undergo strict quality inspections at all stages during the manufacturing process to ensure dimensional stability and consistent thickness. The core and laminates are co-cured under heat and positive pressure, a method that consolidates the laminate, increasing the fibre volume and therefore the strength of the finished panel. The E- glass fibre content of DuFLEX laminates is approximately 62 – 64 % by weight.

Core type and thickness, fibre orientation and ply schedules are based on design, or engineering specifications, to best meet weight targets, stress and impact loads, and other design parameters.

Custom DuFLEX panels with foam, select grade balsa or aramid honeycomb core can be manufactured for high performance projects requiring superior stiffness or lightweightness.","Lightweight, Plastics, composites",Variable,0%,Open,Variable,Hard,Medium,Moderate,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Light,Moderate,No

In the last years, Gommans has seen a growing number of designers and architects from the Benelux implement “Dukta® – flexible wood” in their designs. They confirm what Gommans has always believed in: “Dukta® – flexible wood” fits perfectly into any design.

DUKTA flexible wood can be produced from different materials such as DUKTA (coloured) MDF, possibly provided with a veneer top layer or a lacquered surface, birch plywood, bamboo, multi-layer solid wood, etc. In addition, variation of the groove and groove distance is possible. The basic models are Linar, Sonar, Foli and Janus. A number of variants are shown in the projects shown.

Even though the design aspect is often foregrounded, the acoustic function brings enormous benefits. Testing institutes commend that acoustic function.

It’s a rapid, precise material for fastening various panels, objects and other materials to a fixed substrate. This is a clever fastening system that is much stronger than it looks.

The manufacturers state that it can be used for attaching façade panels to buildings. Advantages include simple, hook-and-loop type attachment (similar to Velcro), both longitudinal and horizontal fastening, and a very thin operating dimension. A panel can be glued to the Duotec material of between 4 and 6 mm.

The tensile disengagement varies between 30 and 35 N/cm2, making the material quite hard to remove once fastened to a large panel.

Various types of the Duotec material are available. Duotec 50 comes in black, with 42 heads per cm2, while the white Duotec 42 features 56 heads per cm2.

As an architectural solution, the material is interesting as it can be released and repositioned. It is also invisible in the finished façade. Uniform distribution of forces across the hooking tape mean the attachment will last longer, too. The material can be used in infrastructure, marine and building environments.

DuraPulp is produced at Södra’s pulp mill in Värö, Sweden, and is produced and delivered in big bales (200 kg). These bales can be converted by customers into a wide variety of products for different industrial applications. DuraPulp is white but it can be tinted during the converting process.

DuraPulp can be used in two different ways – activated or inactivated. When activated, by heat and pressure, the material becomes very strong, rigid, dimensionally stable and has low water absorption. DuraPulp has to be treated at a temperature of 170 – 190°C to be activated.

Examples of processes where DuraPulp can be used include moulding and thermo pressing.

In its unactivated state, DuraPulp is mainly of interest in the specialty paper area where, for example, it can impart high folding resistance, high tear strength and high dimensional stability.

E-GLAS is an active glazing, which converts electrical power into heat. The heating surface of the glazing is low-emissivity glass: when stimulated by electrodes, the thin oxide coating over the inner face on the side of the vacuum (filled with Argon) radiates heat towards the opposite face. Depending on its composition, it can heat outward or inward, and can melt snow, prevents condensation, and constitutes a source of heat itself. The power of E-GLAS is controlled by a different electrical features like thermostats or snow-detectors.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/ecc/,ECC,Concretes,CON024,United States,ACEMRL,"Please note that this Engineered Cement Composites are currently in an experimental phase, although very near to production. This new concrete looks like regular concrete, but is 500 times more resistant to cracking and 40 percent lighter in weight. Tiny fibers that comprise about 2 percent of the mixture’s volume partly account for its performance. Also, the materials in the concrete itself are designed for maximum flexibility. Because of its long life, the Engineered Cement Composites (ECC) are expected to cost less in the long run, as well. The ductile, or bendable, concrete is made mainly of the same ingredients in regular concrete minus the coarse aggregate. It looks exactly like regular concrete, but under excessive strain, the ECC concrete gives because the specially coated network of fibers veining the cement is allowed to slide within the cement, thus avoiding the inflexibility that causes brittleness and breakage.

Lightweight ECC Technology Lightweight concrete with densities between 900 and 1600 Kg/m3 has been used in various structural and non-structural applications, offering considerable weight saving. By adding ductility, lightweight ECC can further broaden the applicability. Four approaches to achieving lightweightedness for a Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) fiber ECC are explored in this project, including uses of air-entrainment admixture, polymeric micro-hollow-bubble, natural lightweight aggregates perlite and glass micro-bubbles. Density, uniaxial tensile behavior, and compressive strength of 15 mix designs are examined. The experimental results show that multiple cracking and strain hardening can be achieved by all these approaches; however, tensile and compressive strengths and robustness of strain capacity significantly vary with content and type of lightweight “filler” used. Mixes by adding glass micro-bubbles with controlled size distribution exhibit more superior mechanical performances than other approaches. For example, tensile strength of 4 MPa with strain capacity above 4% is achieved in a lightweight PVA-ECC with 2% fiber volume fraction at a density of 1450 Kg/m3, along with a compressive strength of 41 MPa.",Concretes,Matte,0%,Open,Smooth,Hard,Medium,Poor,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Medium,Good,No

The proteins and oils contained in the grain are still available as animal feed, for example in the form of corn protein meal.

Depending on the application, the panels can be manufactured in a wide variety of dimensions and thicknesses. Natural fibre laminates consist of either hemp, flax, sisal or other long-fibre agricultural products. They are processed into a fleece felt and pressed with a resin under high pressure.

With the panel, Smarter Habitat wants to offer an alternative to plasterboard, which is used in large quantities in drywall construction. The patented panels have very good technical properties. They can be manufactured in different bulk densities, which means that the technical properties such as strength or soundproofing can be controlled. The fire protection properties achieved by a bio-based flame retardant are particularly noteworthy. The panels can withstand temperatures of 850 degrees for 60 minutes. In addition to drywall, the panels are also suitable as fillings for building elements.

The Smarter Habitat panels therefore offer several advantages: They are both technically and economically competitive and can be manufactured in large quantities. In addition, they are a building block of a CO2-optimized construction and real estate industry.","Biobased, Other naturals, insulation, sheet material, thermal insulation",Matte,0%,Closed,Smooth,Hard,Medium,Moderate,None,Unknown,Unknown,Moderate,Good,Medium,Moderate,Yes

https://materialdistrict.com/material/ecoline-brick-slips/,EcoLine Brick Slips,Ceramics,CER294,Netherlands,Wienerberger B.V.,"EcoLine brick slips are thin-format façade elements developed by Wienerberger that combine the traditional aesthetics of hand-moulded bricks with a modern, resource-efficient production process. With a thickness of only 18 mm, they are among the thinnest in their category, enabling significant material savings and reduced environmental impact.

Designed for both new-build and renovation projects, EcoLine brick slips offer a reliable and sustainable alternative to conventional facing bricks. Their precise dimensional stability makes them especially suitable for prefabricated construction systems where consistency and accuracy are essential.

Manufactured in a fully electric kiln, EcoLine slips are produced without fossil fuels. This energy-efficient process contributes to a reduction in environmental impact of up to 85% compared to traditional brick manufacturing. Due to their reduced thickness, more than three times the square metres of brick slips can be transported per truckload compared to standard bricks. This leads to 70% fewer transport movements, reduced packaging materials, and lower associated CO₂ emissions.

Produced with high precision, the slips maintain consistent shape and size, allowing for smooth integration in industrial and prefab workflows. The slips are delivered ready-to-use without the need for additional drying time on site. Despite being lightweight, EcoLine brick slips are durable and resistant to damage during production, transport, and storage, helping minimise waste.

They are suitable for application on various substrates, including insulation panels and prefabricated concrete elements, using either bonding or casting techniques.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/egg-bioplastic/,Egg bioplastic,Other naturals,ONA855,Netherlands,Basse Stittgen,"Annually, an average of 6.4 billion hens lay 1.1 trillion eggs. Simultaneously one third of all food per year is lost or wasted which includes eggs that have short shelf life and whose fragile shell is not the most suitable protection against processing and transport.

From domestication over to industrialisation, the value of chicken and their eggs has progressively decreased, the shift in human interaction with animals went from cohabitation to first encountering them dead & dissected served on plates.

In the project ‘How do you like your eggs’ the content becomes container, an egg cup is produced from discarded eggs. It explores the extraordinary materiality of an ordinary item of consumption.

There is an ambiguity in the symbolism of the egg which embodies on the one hand the beginning of life and on the other became swallowed up in cheap consumption.

To address this shift of value and to generate awareness for the waste of eggs on an many scales but also for the consumption habits of the individual, in the project ‘How do you like your eggs’ expired egg whites and shells are thermoformed into bioplastic cups with zero additives. In todays context traditional non-degradable plastics are highly problematic, especially because of our throw-away culture; opposed to that in this project a new, fully degradable bioplastic is used to create a narrative about consumption and waste. This can be seen as a novel approach of how plastic can be a conveyor of meaning rather than a pollutant.

The b-stock and damaged eggs used for this project come from the organic farming project Geluksvogel.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/eggshell-based-ceramics-and-bioplastics/,Eggshell-based ceramics and bioplastics,Other naturals,ONA1096,Netherlands,EGGXPERT,"Eggshells, a globally abundant food waste, are increasingly recognized as a sustainable feedstock for innovative materials such as ceramics and bioplastics. Composed of ~94% calcium carbonate (CaCO₃), ~4% organic proteins, and ~2% trace minerals, eggshells possess unique mechanical, thermal, and bioactive properties. Their use aligns with circular economic principles, reducing waste and displacing resource-intensive raw materials like limestone (for ceramics) and synthetic fillers (for plastics). With the Netherlands alone generating an estimated 20,000 – 40,000 metric tons of eggshell waste annually, repurposing this resource offers significant environmental and economic benefits.

Eggshells in Sustainable Ceramics Eggshell-derived calcium carbonate serves as a low-carbon alternative to mined limestone in ceramic production. When processed into fine powder, eggshells act as a natural fluxing agent, lowering the sintering temperature of ceramics by up to 100 – 150°C. This reduces energy consumption and associated CO₂ emissions during kiln firing. Eggshell-based ceramics exhibit enhanced properties:

In the Netherlands, where construction materials account for ~50% of raw material consumption, eggshell ceramics could mitigate resource depletion while valorizing agricultural waste. Applications include eco-friendly tiles, lightweight aggregates, and insulating bricks.

Eggshells in Bioplastics Eggshells are also revolutionizing bioplastics as a biobased filler and biodegradability enhancer. When blended with biopolymers like polylactic acid (PLA), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), starch, or chitosan, eggshell particles (10 – 70% by weight) improve material performance:

Globally, where plastic waste remains a critical issue, eggshells in bioplastics could replace single-use plastics in packaging and agricultural films. The Dutch government’s push for a 50% reduction in virgin plastic use by 2030 aligns with this innovation.

Repurposing eggshells into ceramics and bioplastics delivers key sustainability benefits: waste diversion (reducing landfill use and methane emissions), carbon footprint reduction (eggshell processing emits 60–70% less CO₂ vs. limestone or synthetic fillers), resource conservation (1 ton of eggshells replaces 1 ton of mined limestone), and non-toxicity (biocompatible for safe disposal or medical use). In the Netherlands, leveraging its annual eggshell waste into eco-friendly construction materials, packaging, and and consumer products. This approach aligns with circular economic goals, cutting industrial emissions and preserving natural resources. By integrating agriculture and manufacturing, eggshell valorization offers a scalable model to address global plastic and ceramic waste challenges, demonstrating how regional waste streams can drive sustainable innovation while reducing reliance on finite raw materials.

EGGXPERT collaborated with Addit Studio, who designed and 3D printed material samples combining eggshell-derived calcium carbonate with ceramics and bioplastics, advancing the exploration of these sustainable materials for practical applications.","Biobased, Sustainable, Other naturals",Variable,0%,Open,Coarse,Hard,Cool,Good,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Medium,Good,Yes
https://materialdistrict.com/material/eggshell-ceramic/,Eggshell Ceramic,Ceramics,CER259,Netherlands,Atelier LVDW,"10 billion eggs a year are produced in the Netherlands, which makes the country the largest egg exporter in the world. An egg produces a valuable material which is often seen as waste; its shell. Luckily, not all 10 billion eggshells are wasted, it’s often used as soil improver in agriculture. Eggshell Ceramic is a circular material derived from this industry to show new possibilities with this material. This project shows that we can also use the material one more time before it is given back to nature. Atelier LVDW developed a biodegradable but strong material out of the eggshells. The material can easily be recycled into calcium water, composted, or placed directly in the soil. This project creates an extra “dot” in this materials lifecycle. Eggshell Ceramic received a Gold Award in the BeyondPlastic competition 2021.

The fragile eggshell is inlaid into one of nature’s most durable products, lacquer. Eggshell inlay uses duck eggs that have already hatched, because of their inherent thickness and whiteness. The shells are cleaned, arranged in a pan and carefully roasted over a bed of hot charcoal. A range of coloration can be achieved, ranging from light mocha to deep chocolate to burnished gold to ash black. Delicate – fingered, keen – eyed artisans puzzle out patterns of irregular geometry. Each piece is carefully glued, one shard at a time, on to the readied mold. Multiple layers of lacquer are then applied and the piece is finished with purified beeswax polished to a high gloss.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/electroluminescent-textiles/,Electroluminescent textiles,Plastics,PLA1226,Sweden,Smart Textiles,"In this research, the aim was to explore the materiality of light through a textile design perspective. Print designs were developed with textile printing methodology, using multiple screens and blending ink colours through mixing and overprinting. This is in contrast to existing electroluminescent panels, which typically use single-colour prints with clear graphic shapes.

These electroluminescent prints consist of a transparent electrode, printed first in pattern with a phosphor paste, then a ceramic dielectric layer, and finally a second electrode. When alternating current is applied through the electrodes, the phosphor illuminates.

Sample one emphasises the clarity of a single screen phosphor print, but is printed using a blend of two colours of phosphor ink, usually used unmixed. The scratchy detail of the knit pattern adds texture and depth.

Sample two takes advantage of the blue phosphor’s translucency, creating a three-colour print using only two screens through overlapping and blending. The design is based on a twill weave, and, rather than the clean edges of typical electroluminescent printing, embraces the speckled background as a pattern element. The alignment of the two layers of the printed pattern lends a visual depth to the result, in contrast to the flatness of sample one.

The pattern in sample three is created by rasterising and combining images of two knitted textiles. The use of two complementary colours in the print amplifies the raster, creating a visual vibration that keeps the eye moving over the pattern surface.","Sense & Sensibility, Smart Materials, Plastics, electroluminescent",Glossy,0%,Closed,Smooth,Resilient,Medium,Poor,None,Moderate,Good,Poor,Moderate,Medium,Moderate,No

It can be cut into narrow strips to form conducting wires or ties. It can also be used as a soft compliant substitute for metal and foil in switches and sensors.

Interestingly, its conductivity depends how tightly it is stretched so if the fabric is pulled, the resistance increases. The resistance drops again when the material is stretched very tightly. In a thin strip, the material also warms up when current is passed through it. This provides the basis of a heated garment or product such as a hat or gloves.

Elite Lava can only be used for indoor purposes and the size of the available mesh is 30x 30 x 1,5 cm.

Mosaics such as Elite Lava are made of small, flat, roughly square, pieces of stone or glass of different colours, known as tesserae; but some, especially floor mosaics, may also be made of small rounded pieces of stone, and called “pebble mosaics.” Mosaic has a long history, starting in Mesopotamia in the 3rd millennium BC. Pebble mosaics were made in Tiryns in Mycenean Greece while mosaics with patterns and pictures became widespread in classical times, both in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome.

Mosaics such as Elite Lava are used to break the monotony of a sole type of wall covering and are also used as decorative borders or to frame different zones such as the shower or a basin.","Sense & Sensibility, Natural stones",Variable,0%,Closed,Coarse,Hard,Medium,Moderate,None,Moderate,Good,Moderate,Good,Medium,Moderate,No

Based on customized recipes, eLM Zero partially substitutes conventional inputs like cement and aggregates.

Using eLM Zero, concrete can be produced with a net zero CO2-footprint. This means that the amount of carbon sequestered and stored in the concrete (insetting ) is equal to the embodied carbon from virgin materials like cement and the operational carbon emitted during its manufacturing process.

Concrete containing eLM Zero can be recycled just like conventional concrete, making it suitable for further use without releasing carbon . The captured carbon will remain securely bound within the cement matrix for millennia.

Integration into existing processes at the factory is achieved through manual or silo dosing, similar to other additives or fillers in powder form.

eLM Zero is ideal for abating the CO2-footprint of various concrete products, including ready-mix concrete, precast, pavers, slabs, street furniture, stairs, roof tiles, wall panels, façades, and decorative elements. It can be easily mixed into concrete at the plant or construction site.

The material can be integrated into both manual and automated processes. For small-scale operations, manual integration using sack dosage is straightforward and efficient.

KG,"Ettlin Lux is a fabric that creates a 3D effect and visual depth in combination with LED light. The luminous structures are formed by interaction of the fabric with a point source of light situated behind the fabric. For viewers, each individual point of light is shaped into a bent line of light. If several points of light are used, all lines run together in the same direction with exactly the same curve: the fabric dictates the direction of the effect. LEDs are particularly suitable as light source, as they provide a concentrated luminosity and a lot of flexibility for colours and shapes.

The distribution of the light structures can be influenced by positioning of the fabric in relation to the light source, i.e. the larger the distance between fabric and LEDs, the longer the lines of light will be. But the result does not only change technically but also optically for the observer depending on the viewing angle. This creates a dynamic light image.

The result is a lightweight yet durable material with high stability.

A key feature of euca wood is its reusability. It can be soaked in water and returned to a mouldable state, allowing for extended life cycles. This enables products to be redesigned or repurposed multiple times. All components are derived entirely from natural and renewable resources. euca wood is available in different textures, making it versatile for product design and manufacturing. Its lightness and strength allows it’s use also for furniture and interior design elements. Additional applications include wall and acoustic panels, offering aesthetic and functional benefits for interior spaces.

Exogrid Technology is particularly well suited to applications where lightweight and high-stiffness/strength are critical.

It is manufactured using female bladder moulding (requires tooling). ExoGrid structures start with a base metal (such as titanium) structure that then has a major portion of the surface area removed through advanced machining techniques, such as laser machining. The resulting lightweight metal shell is then fused (using the VyaTek’s patented Bi/Fusion Technology) with an advanced composite inner structure using elevated temperature and pressure.

ExoGrid is lightweight, strong and has adjustable torsion strength depending on composite layup. Multi-material Exogrid structures possess unique vibration damping qualities due to the dissimilar natural frequencies of the fiber based composites and base metals. This vibration damping effect gives improved “feel” to bicycles frames and components when compared to the vibrations generated by single material metal surfaces.

ExoGrid can be made with a variety of different alloys and a variety of different carbon weaves. It can be left raw if using a tarnish-proof alloy like Titanium. It can be painted a variety of different colours or even finished with a translucent colour dye. The gloss level depends on the amount of polishing of the metal or composite surfaces.

These finished parts may be components in a system, such as with automotive bumper systems, or stand-alone products, such as with dunnage, or reusable product packaging for industry.EPP, Porous EPP and EPE are recyclable, environmentally-sound materials. EPP readily absorbs energy – the main reason it’sused extensively as a key component of energy management systems in automotive bumpers and other applications. EPP resists repeated blows by returning to its original shape after absorbing impact energy. EPP can be made lightweight, which can be an added benefit. For example, weight savings in automotive applications contribute to overall fuel economy. Not only can EPP serve as a cushioning and dampening material, it can provide load-bearing capabilities in certain applications. One or more portions of an EPP component can be made denser than another portion within that same component. Because of its closed-cell foam structure, EPP has thermal properties that can be an advantage in some applications. EPP is chemically inert, and is functionally unaffected by exposure to water, most oils and chemicals. There are formulations of EPP that are resistant to UV exposure, physical abuse, temperature extremes (from freezing to 130° C), abrasion, and other environmental stresses. As a closed-cell foam, EPP provides long term buoyancy, and is virtually unaffected when exposed to salt water. EPP has “memory,” that is, it bends yet returns to its original shape.

Artificilae/Matter is a speculative project in which science has been harnessed in an alchemic fashion, to synthesise amalgamated matter, yielding new dimensions of material. Crystals are grown from woven and embroidered fabric to create mineral surfaces of cultivated embellishment. This treatment of material aims to shed a new perspective on the future of the development of textiles.

The embroidery collection uses embroidery stitch, laminating, weaving, bonding, applique, laser-cutting, hand painting, fabric and yarn manipulation to create unique textiles, often with a 3D effect.

On the photos you can see three examples of MUUNA’s capabilities. The circle sequin fabric is hand cut, patinated steel mesh that has been hand embroidered.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/exploform/,Exploform,Metals,MET036,Netherlands,Exploform,"Explosive forming is a technique for manufacturing wall panels out of sheet metal. The technique can be applied to many different types of metal to produce a virtually unlimited range of shapes and sizes.

Conventional pressing requires two mould forms and a positioning system, butexplosive forming requires only one mould form, reducing one-time costs.Explosive forming uses the force of an explosion to shape the metal sheet. The sheetis placed on a mould which is then submerged in water in which explosive has beenplaced. The force of the explosion presses the metal sheet into the mould form.In the 1950s explosive forming was mainly used in the aviation industry. Bythe1980s the technique had almost completed disappeared, but in 1995 TNO, the Dutch research establishment, carried out research into ways of using explosiveforming to satisfy the requirements of the day. The research revealed that explosiveforming was eminently suitable for the production of modern facades of high archi-tectural quality. Since there were no longer any suppliers of explosive forming ser-vices TNO set up a supplier itself, Exploform B.V.Two products suitable for architectural use are relief panels for flat elevations andcorner pieces for curved elevations.

Relief panelsRelief panels are flat sheets incorporating a motif. The motif can have any form required and can be different for each sheet. Although a different mould is requiredfor each motif, the moulds are relatively cheap.One example of the use of relief panels is for the frontage of the theatre/cinemacomplex in Alphen aan de Rijn, designed by Kraaijvanger Urbis architects. A wavepattern – given the name ’Desert Storm’ by the architect, Dirkjan Postel – wasmoulded into pre-painted aluminium sheets. The cost of the project was reduced bymoulding several sheets at the same time. Architect-designed buildings with curved metal elevations are costly. Each double-curved panel requires a mould to suit the particular panel. Exploform suggests twosteps to make a curved elevation affordable: 1. if possible make the elevation flat or single curved (i.e. bowed or twisted),so that no special mould is required 2. if possible make the double-curved parts of the elevation repeating, so that fewer expensive moulds are required.Neither of these steps should require any significant change to the design ofthe elevation.",Metals,Satin,0%,Open,Medium,Hard,Cool,Poor,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Light,Good,No

https://materialdistrict.com/material/faay-the-worlds-most-sustainable-partition-wall/,Faay,Other naturals,ONA990,Netherlands,Faay Vianen B.V.,"The world’s most sustainable partition wall FAAY Vianen produces and sells partition walls using flax, an inexhaustible raw material that is renewable, reusable and environmentally friendly (biobased). During cultivation, flax absorbs CO2 and converts it into oxygen. For example, by using flax as a raw material for building materials, CO2 can be captured in a building. As a result, it has a positive effect on the greenhouse gas. If the building, in which ‘bio-based’ materials are processed, is demolished, the materials can be reused (and the CO2 is stored) or they are broken down in nature (and the CO2 is released with a delay of 60, 100 or more years).

Why flax as raw material? For over 50 years, FAAY Vianen has focused on the principles of the circular economy utilizing locally grown flax to form the biobased core of its partition walls. Flax has a short growth cycle, is renewable and reusable, takes CO2 from the atmosphere and stores it, has a natural ability to regulate temperature and moisture, contains no harmful dust particles and is recyclable. In addition, the flax core is very strong and stable, provides excellent acoustic properties, has good fire resistance and excellent screw-holding properties.

A FAAY PARTITION WALL STORES MORE THAN 580 KG CO2 PER M3

Prefab, flexible, reusable, easily installed and life cycle proof FAAY makes robust, screw-proof walls with qualities. The solid flax core guarantees a very high degree of sustainability. FAAY’s environmentally friendly prefab walls are a modular system. The panels are, if not glued, dismountable and reusable. The result of reuse is less transport, labour and waste. FAAY is the first wall manufacturer in the Netherlands with a takeback option for the circular (flax) core wall.

100% sustainable All unfinished FAAY partition walls are ‘green’. They use wood, flax and plaster as a basis: inexhaustible, environmentally friendly biobased materials. The efforts in the field of sustainability have already resulted in many great rewards in the form of various (inter)national recognitions and certificates. Think of ISO 14001/environmental effects and ISO 9001/quality management, KOMO, FSC® and PEFC.

The wood comes from sustainably managed forests in Europe with an FSC® or PEFC certificate. FaunaWood has a good balance with the lifespan of additional products such as mesh and fasteners.

Efficient use of wood By using peeled posts, waste from milling is avoided and the wood is used more efficiently. FaunaWood can also work with more local wood, so that dependence on a limited supply will no longer be a problem.

FaunaWood has been developed in the framework of the Bio4Products project , which received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 723070.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/feathered-fabrics/,Feathered Fabrics,Other naturals,ONA809,Netherlands,Pascale Theron,"Feathered Fabrics are fabrics with ostrich feathers interwoven into them. The ostrich feather was once a highly valued commodity during the 19th century, as Victorian and Edwardian woman sought out big plumes to decorate their flamboyant hats. Since then, the feather has fallen from grace and now its main use is removing dust or in carnival costumes.

Collecting feathers from the ostrich is the removal of dead material and is the equivalent to cutting fingernails, causing no pain to the bird. It could be a very functional interior textile, as well as a new solution to the fashion industry, as an alternative to fur.

Only the natural uncoloured feathers are chosen to make the fabrics, as they would be found on the bird. By removing the central shaft, and only using the soft, thread-like barbules, the feathers can be combined to make a yarn that is then woven into a fabric. The aim of the project is to bring the manufacturing back to the town of Oudtshoorn in South Africa, also known as “the ostrich capital of the world”, and actually have the feathered fabrics locally produced in the place where it all began. Using the feathers within the fabric differs from the way that ostrich feathers are currently being used in the fashion industry (usually just sewn or glued on top of fabric as decoration). The breathable, washable, soft, warm and incredibly light weight textural qualities of the feathers mean it can be used in a variety of practical ways.

By harnessing the qualities of the feathers and creating a new craft through these feathered textiles, it could not only save many animals lives, but also could create a new industry of economic value to the small deserted town of Oudtshoorn.","Acoustic, Biobased, Sense & Sensibility, Other naturals, fabric, feathers, fur alternative, textile",Matte,0-50%,Open,Medium,Soft,Warm,Good,None,Unknown,Good,Moderate,Moderate,Light,Moderate,Yes

Textile designs within Febrik’s collection include Sprinkles, Razzle Dazzle, Uniform Mélange and Triangle.

Designed by Bertjan Pot, a close-up inspection of the multi-layered, knitted textile Sprinkles reveals a kaleidoscopic gathering of coloured dots. Looked upon from a distance, the colours are subdued by a subtle abstraction. The dots appear to alter in colour depending on the perspective of the spectator.

Razzle Dazzle is designed by Sylvain Willenz and is named after the camouflage painting technique that inspired its pattern of intersecting lines. This textile is notable for a bold graphic contrast that has a resemblance to the Dutch polder landscape as seen from the sky. Razzle Dazzle is available in three variations: two-tone contrast, mélange and plain colour – each of which imbues a distinctive effect.

With a smooth appearance and compliant nature, Uniform Mélange is available in a range of refined colour tones. When applied as upholstery, the fabric adapts to fit countless shapes without resistance. Due to the textile’s inherent stretch, seams are reduced to a bare minimum.

It achieves the thermal performance of triple glazing while maintaining the slim profile and appearance of single glazing. At the core of FINEO’s performance is a vacuum cavity of 0.1 mm between two panes of glass, supported by a network of micro-pillars and combined with a low-emissivity coating. This structure enables a thermal transmittance (Ug) of 0.7 W/m²K, offering a high level of insulation in a unit with significantly reduced thickness and weight compared to traditional triple glazing.

The glass is available in a range of formats, each tailored to specific functional requirements such as solar control, sound insulation, impact resistance, and heritage restoration. Its overall thickness starts from just 6.7 mm, and it weighs approximately 40 per cent less than triple glazing. This lightweight structure allows FINEO to be installed into existing window frames in suitable condition, which reduces labour and avoids the need for complete frame replacement. As a result, it is particularly suited to renovation and restoration projects, including those involving listed or historical buildings.

FINEO combines high energy efficiency with acoustic performance. Certain product configurations provide sound reduction values of up to 39 dB, improving indoor comfort in buildings exposed to traffic and urban noise. At the same time, the slim profile of the glass facilitates a higher level of natural daylight penetration, with light transmittance reaching up to 80 per cent. This improves interior brightness without compromising on insulation values.

The glass is manufactured in Belgium using lead-free, metal-free and fully recyclable materials, making it compatible with circular economy principles. It holds CE marking and national certifications in several European countries, including Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Germany. In addition to its environmental credentials, FINEO offers a service life of at least 60 years and is covered by a 20-year full product warranty.

Variants include FINEO Solar Control, which integrates a solar-protective coating to limit overheating in buildings with large or south-facing glass surfaces, and FINEO Acoustic, which is optimised for sound insulation. FINEO Heritage is designed to match the visual characteristics of historical glazing while enhancing building energy performance. FINEO Hybrid, the most insulating version, reaches Ug values as low as 0.4 W/m²K and is intended for high-performance new construction.

The high quality 3D printer filament is made from 100% recycled marine nylon.

Fishy Filaments’ recycled nylon (otherwise known as PA6) is unusual, possibly unique, in the world of 3D printing filaments. The company can track the polymers they reclaim all the way from their original sources, mostly in Japan, through the global fishing net supply chain, the commercial fishery and ultimately to their doorstep. This is possible is because the nylon used by commercial fisheries is made to very high standards in order to meet the demands of an extremely tough industry.

But just to make sure they know exactly what the net material is and where it is coming from, Fishy Filaments has carried out scientific analysis to confirm documentary evidence. They have also commissioned independent 3rd party labs to make sure that the material we gather isn’t becoming contaminated or chemically altered through its life.

The nets have typically been used by Cornish fishers for 3-6 months, and very rarely any longer as their surfaces become cloudy and they stop catching fish. Net lofts around Cornwall re-string frame lines (the ropes on the top and bottom of each net panel) whenever a panel gets too worn or gets ripped, and Fishy Filaments gathers both full panels at the end of their useful life and fragments of repaired nets.

So the nylon might be a bit salty and have a few bits of seaweed attached but the underlying high quality polymer is still there and Fishy Filaments does our very best to make sure that they don’t destroy its value by over processing, adding pigments or including other chemical modifiers.

All the polymer blends are 100% recycled. No pigments or other modifiers are added. Instead, Fishy Filaments works with the nets they receive, grade them according to colour and wear, and process them separately in order to maximise their potential. They then combine the grades to provide customers with a consistent blend that they can add their own uniqueness and value to through 3D printing.","Recycling, Plastics, 3D printing, additive manufacturing, filament",Satin,0-50%,Closed,Smooth,Hard,Medium,Moderate,None,Poor,Good,Good,Good,Light,Moderate,No

Because this type of paint is made from renewable and often mineral resources, it is biodegradable and therefore fits into the ecological cycle.

Synthetic paint is oil based. It is not biodegradable and the production process requires considerable amounts of raw materials and energy. Furthermore, the production process results in considerable chemical waste. The manufacturing of flax or linseed oil paint by contrast is a sustainable process, from raw material to finished product. The drying process occurs by the absorption of oxygen (oxidative drying). Compared to synthetic enamels this process is slower, but this paint does have a strong penetrating and adhesiveness effect. This creates a good anchoring on new and existing surfaces. The surface can sometimes still be a bit stiff and sticky feel, but this is normal.","Biobased, Coatings",Matte,0%,Closed,Smooth,Hard,Warm,Poor,Moderate,Moderate,Good,Good,Good,Light,Good,Yes

https://materialdistrict.com/material/flax-wall-core/,Flax wall core,Other naturals,ONA663,Netherlands,Faay Vianen B.V.,"Flax is one of the oldest known textile plants in the world. Its Latin name is ‘Linum Usitatissimum’. Linum stands for the fabric that can be made from this plant, i.e. linen. Usitatissimum means: very useful. Flax is an arable crop which grows extremely well on the clay soils in the Netherlands (Zeeland), Belgium and Northern France, in combination with the prevailing climate. In essence there are two types: linseed and flax. Linseed is used to produce oilseeds, better known as linseed oil.

Flax, on the other hand, is grown primarily for the production of linen and yarns (long fibres). It is mainly used in garments, and table and bed linens. This production and processing process, produces various by-products:

Good building physical properties These solid panels are used in the construction industry for the interiors of buildings, for example, in doors, kitchen worktops and partition walls. Faay uses these ‘flax straw’ panels, as a basis for their walls. The solid flax core guarantees a very high degree of sustainability.

Flax is light-weight and fire-retardant. It has a tough structure and does not burn, but smoulders instead. Flax furthermore has high insulation and dB values. The flax chipboard panels are 100% biodegradable and 100% recyclable as part of the process. Faay’s flax walls can be supplied in various heights and thicknesses and offer many possibilities in new developments, refurbishments and transformations. For retail, industrial premises and homes.

FSC on flax please! When it comes to sustainable building, in particular, construction materials made from renewable raw materials – such as flax – are a very interesting option. On top of that the environmental impact involved in the production of flax is low. That is because flax absorbs CO2 and converts it into oxygen while it is growing and it has a low energy content during the processing process which means its environmental impact is low. The local growing and processing of flax furthermore reduces polluting transport to a minimum.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/flax-wallpaper/,Flax wallpaper,Other naturals,ONA671,Germany,Norafin Industries (Germany) GmbH,"Flax offers the opportunity to produce nonwovens with outstanding properties such as extreme tear-resistance, durability, and robustness at a relatively low production cost. This wallpaper is high tear- and UV-resistance, a soft touch, and has good insulating properties. It does not require a supporting material and can be applied directly to the wall with the specially developed glue for flax wallpaper.

The flax wallpaper is able to assimilate air humidity by absorbing moisture and releasing it when necessary, thus ensuring a good, natural indoor climate at any time. The flax wallpaper exclusively consists of natural components – flax and viscose. It is environmentally and health friendly, easily removable, and completely compostable.

The wallpaper can be imprinted or embroidered. A fluorocarbon free hydrophobizing can be applied which makes the wallpaper wash resistant and protects it against yellowing, without reducing its breathability.

Through their natural elastic module, their minimal mass in comparison to carbon or glass fibres, vibration dampening features, and their UV resistance, flax fibres have many advantages when compared to synthetic fibres. Another essential advantage of the flax fibre is its ecological cultivation and degradation. The cultivation of flax requires far less water in comparison to other natural fibres. Furthermore the flax fibre grows on meager soil and in adequate growing areas does not require any chemical fertiliser.","Biobased, Healing Environment, Sustainable, Other naturals, flax, wall covering, wallpaper",Matte,0-50%,Closed,Smooth,Soft,Warm,Moderate,None,Poor,Good,Poor,Moderate,Light,Moderate,Yes
https://materialdistrict.com/material/flax/,Flax,Other naturals,ONA247,Germany,Norafin Industries (Germany) GmbH,"Flax are natural fibres used in the manufacturing of technical textiles and nonwovens, characterised by high durability, robustness and great tensile strength. Through their natural strengthening qualities, their low weight compared to carbon or glass fibers, as well as their vibrant absorbing properties, flax fibers have many attributes which can be capitalized in composites. In order to achieve a better uniformity of the fibers used, the long flax fibers can be processed to shorter staple fibers to increase their quality level. The specific fiber properties may also lead to special machinery adjustments in the area of the spunlace technology.

Thanks to the UV resistance of the flax fibers, their positive eco-balance as well as their natural aspect, flax fibers can be used in the home furnishing market, as for example as sun shades. In the construction industry, flax fibers are used as high breathable roofing membranes. Since flax is exceptionally tear resistant and robust, which make the fibers tough, hard-wearing and long lasting, it represents a valuable alternative to synthetically manufactured membranes in the roofing sector. For a 125 g/m2 weight nonwoven material made of 100% flax, a tensile strength value of 220 N/5 cm is achieved. If a scrim made of natural fibers or fiberglass is additionally included into the nonwoven material, tensile strength values can be achieved that are far beyond those of the scrim by itself. When using a 135 g/m2 weighted nonwoven material with a fiberglass scrim, the tensile strength value is 955 N/5 cm (see table).

If flax is used within composites that use natural resins only, the product advantages are more evident. Apart from having a strong product solution, the good recyclability of the fiber allows the reutilization of the material as for example as cellulose paper.","Biobased, Other naturals, flax",Satin,0%,Closed,Smooth,Resilient,Warm,Poor,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Light,Moderate,Yes

https://materialdistrict.com/material/fleece-n-flex/,Fleece ’n ’Flex,Wood,WOO059,Germany,Schorn & Groh GmbH,"More than 4000 years ago the Egyptians discovered how to use wood, a highly desirable material, economically. Because wood in hot desert regions was both rare and valuable, they sawed tree trunks into the thinnest boards possible. Veneer really came into its own during the Renaissance, when nothing much had changed in production techniques. Production processes for veneer were first industrialized in the 19th century. Today it is hard to imagine the furniture and door-making industries, shipbuilding, aircraft construction and the automobile industry without veneer.

Fleece on the backside of veneer turns normal spliced veneer into Fleece ’n’Flex. The major advantage of this new fleeced veneer from Schorn & Groh is great stability; the veneer can be formed without splitting or tearing. This makes processing easier and helps to reduce costs. The weight of the fleece and the type of adhesive determine the product quality, stability, strength and resistance to heat and humidity.

Fleece ’n’Flex is particularly suitable for multi-dimensional shaping, especially where veneer is glued onto hard-to-work-with surfaces. All conventional joint techniques can be used on fleeced veneer. Schorn & Groh offer fleeced spliced veneers (e.g., wood species mix) in all joint techniques using urea resin up to a size of about 3.1 m x 1.25 m) – in burl veneers too. In general, the addition of fleece can make any species of wood both stable and flexible. They also offer sanded spliced veneers up to a width of 1.250 mm. This product results in significant cost reductions, especially in 3-D deformation work.

It was developed by Koninklijke Van Wijhe Verf, which focuses on sustainability and environmental friendliness. This paint is part of the Concept Paints line and is designed to significantly reduce environmental impact. It has a carbon footprint of only 24 Kg CO2Eq per 100 Kg of product, which is significantly lower than that of traditional paints.

One of the most notable features of Flower Power is that it is completely free of titanium dioxide, a pigment often used to make paint whiter, but which has a very negative impact on the carbon footprint. Titanium dioxide is usually imported from China and undergoes a polluting production process. By eliminating this pigment, the wall paint has a much lower environmental impact. It also contains no primary microplastics. The paint is biodegradable, which means it will not produce secondary microplastics when, for example, sanded or peeled. This is an important step towards clean and sustainable paints.

Flower Power is also biobased, which means that the raw materials come from renewable sources that can grow back within the product’s lifespan. The total biobased content of Flower Power is 61%, measured according to the NEN 16640 standard. This is significantly higher than current existing wall paints. To colour the product, natural pigments developed in collaboration with suppliers are used. These pigments have been tested for coverage, gloss, colour fastness, and scrub resistance, and the results are positive.

The paint is designed to be applied with a brush, roller, or spray. When applied, the paint has a transparent character, but it dries opaque. This requires the painting industry and consumers to look at paint differently.

The hides are folded into intricate paper moulds that were designed and made by hand, and which follow patterns that borrow inspiration from traditional pleating techniques. These are then subjected to high temperature processes to give the leather the form and structure of scales and shells. Once the leather is treated its shape is permanent, becoming three-dimensional, flexible and textural.

These new qualities open up rich possibilities for panelling, upholstery and soft furniture, and can add a sculptural layer to otherwise two-dimensional surfaces. You can watch these fascinating videos showing the leather folding processes behind this material here , here and here .

https://materialdistrict.com/material/food-waste-pigment/,Food Waste Pigment,Coatings,COA303,Netherlands,Sara van Laerhoven,"Designers and artists are working a lot with colour. This can be digital, but also in the form of ink. Colour and printing have almost become something normal. You press the print button, and a beautiful, coloured sheet comes out of the printer, but how the colours are made we are often not concerned with.

With her graduation project, The Colour of Waste, Sara van Laerhoven wanted to go back to basics and show how special and beautiful colour can be and that it can be natural. She made her process visual to inspire and motivate others to try it themselves.

By using material research, she found a way to make a natural alternative to synthetic inks to use in graphic workshops. This alternative is made from food waste. In this case from coffee grounds, avocado seeds, red cabbages and orange peels.

A lake pigment is made by transforming a soluble dye into an insoluble pigment. This is done by combining a dye with an inert binder (metallic salt) to make the dye insoluble in water. First, extract dye from the food waste by infusing it into a liquid. Combine the dye with a metallic salt. Sara used alum and washing soda for an alkali. Once the alkali is added the alum becomes solid again, and the colour will stick to the alum. When this is filtered out of the remaining dye solution, dried and ground. What is left is the pigment.

Pigments have some advantages over dyes. The pigments are meant to be long-lasting and durable. Lake pigments can be applied widely by mixing it with different binders, for example printing, painting, and colouring various materials such as textiles, paper, and wood. But you can also use it for making pastels and crayons.","Biobased, Coatings, food waste, pigment",Matte,0-50%,Closed,Medium,Resilient,Medium,Poor,Moderate,Unknown,Moderate,,Poor,Light,,Yes

https://materialdistrict.com/material/for-the-sea/,For the sea,Other naturals,ONA1081,France,Santa Ramaherison,"Over-absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide by the ocean lowers the ocean’s pH, causing a 30% increase in ocean acidity since the industrial era. This change is starting to harm marine ecosystems, but this has been overlooked in the public, as people tend to see the needs of humans as a priority without thinking about the needs of ecosystems. Considered the “evil twin of climate change”, its effects are still mostly impacting marine life – not humans. However, communities relying on the fish industry are already seeing the negative impacts, as we can see in Madagascar or other vulnerable countries (coupled with coral bleaching, an effect of global warming).

Expanded polystyrene is the leading form of marine litter from the ocean and coastal aquaculture activities, but there are currently no global estimates for the amounts of marine plastic litter generated from this sector. This project tackles the issue of Ocean Acidification from the root of CO2 emissions by replacing fossil fuel-based materials used for beach activities objects with pH-neutralising (adsorbing) natural reclaimed materials (oyster shells), natural CO2 absorbing minerals (Olivine) and natural seaweed binders, which not only cuts down CO2 emissions but also has the added value to help regenerate ecosystems at the end of life of the product.

The material, whilst looking as heavy as concrete, is in fact quite light: one tray only weighs 80 grams and is also food safe. After use, the object is made to be left on the beach to act as a deacidifying agent for marine ecosystems. It will take 14 days to dissolve, so it will not cause any visual or environmental harm to the surrounding ecosystem either. Finally, the material can also be used as fertiliser for soils or compost, as it also acts as a natural pH neutralising agent for soils, after breaking down the whole product into small pieces or powder after use.","Biodegradable, Healing Environment, Other naturals, packaging",Matte,0%,Closed,Variable,Hard,Cool,Moderate,None,Unknown,Unknown,Moderate,Good,Light,Moderate,Yes

All of that by not using a single drop of dyestuff; the colour in the textile comes from the recycled fibres in the yarns. This way, thousands of litres of water and kilograms of CO2 for every kilogram of produced textile are saved.

Soetekouw and Enschede Texielstad only use yarns from European spinning mills, to guarantee their origin and limit the CO2 footprint. Textile waste, for instance discarded workwear or waste from garment manufacturing companies is shredded, carded and spun into yarn. Those yarns are used to weave a colourful, sustainable and durable textile.

The fabrics are produced on demand. That way, they never have any unsold stock or other waste. Don’t worry; this doesn’t a ect lead times: they can deliver within 3-4 weeks and can weave up to 10.000 meters a week if necessary.","Biobased, Recycling, Sustainable, Other naturals, cotton, fabric, textile",Matte,0-50%,Open,Medium,Soft,Warm,Moderate,None,Moderate,Good,Moderate,Moderate,Medium,Moderate,Yes

Laser engraving is the practice of using laser to engrave or mark a fabric, removing more or less substantially, sometimes imperceptibly to the touch the surface of the fabric, resulting into different shading effects.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/from-ash/,From Ash,Concretes,CON164,Switzerland,Thomas Missé,"The aim of From Ash is to use the common waste material fly ash as the main element of a new production process. The alkali-activated material is part of the geopolymer family and can easily be made by using basic chemical components. The material becomes mechanically strong within a few hours, allowing a simple production system everywhere near the thermal power plant.

Despite the global consensus on the reduction of coal as an energy source, the economic conjuncture offers to this fossil fuel some decades of intense use. Considering this reality, From Ash is presenting an economical and sustainable material for the afterlife of coal wastes.

Those coal plants are creating energy by burning coal at high temperature. This high temperature is followed by a fast cooling process, creating some by-products, including a very thin dust called fly ash. This fly ash represents around 75% of the coal ash, with a production over 500 million tonnes a year for China and the U.S.A. combined.

A part of the fly ash is recycled as a binder for Portland concrete, making the concrete cheaper and increasing its mechanical properties. But most of the material is wetted and stored on site. However, raw fly ash is by itself the main ingredient of another kind of polymer, more thermally, mechanically and chemically resistant than Portland cement.","Sustainable, Concretes, fly ash",Variable,0%,Closed,Variable,Hard,Medium,Poor,None,Good,Unknown,Moderate,Moderate,Medium,Good,No

As a raw material, silkworm cocoons are made from hundreds of meters of silk threads held together with sericin, a natural glue material. When extracted, it is possible to re-active seracin by wetting and heating its fibres to create a strong material similar to paper. This paper is then layered and varnished to create a material that is similar to wood.

The varnish Huissoud uses is also her own biologically inspired creation and made from honey bee propolis. This is a resin like material that bees collect from trees and use as a sealant in their hives. It is ideal as a varnish because of its strength and glossy appearance.

Huissoud describes her wooden leather in this way: ‘The wooden aspect of the material comes from the thousands of thousands of fibres combined together in the silkworm’s paper. This new material can be used for different applications such as furniture design, fashion design and surface design.’

Fungi Force is a natural black stain that consists of two separate components. On the one hand the biofinish, an organic water-based stain with black pigmented fungi (Aureobasidium pullulans) and on the other hand the oil finish, a vegetable fatty oil from linseed. Both Fungi Force Biofinish and Fungi Force Oilfinish do not contain harmful chemicals. The linseed oil serves as food for the fungus and also keeps moisture out of the wood. The fungus protects the wood against the destructive power of UV radiation and also keeps other fungi out of the wood.

With Fungi Force you can apply an organic matte black protective layer to exterior wood yourself. The biofinish blocks harmful solar radiation and thus protects the oil and wood. The oil has a moisture-regulating effect on the wood and keeps the biofinish in good condition. Through simple, periodic post-treatment with the natural Fungi Force oil finish, the biofinish is optimally able to repair itself in the event of minor damage.

Each sheet consists of 100% natural fibers and natural binders. It is a high-quality decorative biolaminate with a beautiful natural appearance.

The possibilities are endless, VanHier processes agricultural, horticultural and natural waste: reed clippings, roses waste, Christmas trees, cattail, sorghum, grass clippings, and there are even more possibilities. Another important ingredient is cellulose from elephants grass. This fast growing crop stores 4 times more CO2 than a similar forest-area.

Specifications FytoPanel has a thickness of approximately 2 mm, is scratch resistant, recyclable, degradable (compostable) and moisture repellent. The material is suitable for indoor applications. The natural fibers are clearly visible in the sheets. Each waste stream has different properties and a different look.

Unlike plastic sheet material, FytoPanel is biodegradable (compostable), recyclable, not harmful to nature and climate positive.

Applications To obtain more strength properties, it is possible to laminate multiple (veneer) sheets with a natural binder. It is comparable with plywood. The thin sheets can be cut with a laser cutter into any shape and thus offer numerous design possibilities.

VanHier offers different colours of sheets by adding natural non-damaging colour pigments. They work with semi-transparent colours so the decorative effect of the natural fibers remains visible.

Hopefully FytoPanel will inspire designers to create interesting beautiful applications for this new material: for wall finishes, furniture and product design!","Biobased, Other naturals, sheet material, veneer",Variable,0%,Closed,Smooth,Resilient,Medium,Moderate,Moderate,Unknown,Unknown,Moderate,Moderate,Light,Moderate,Yes

The process aimed to create a material which is less impactful to the environment, zero waste, circular and fully recyclable. In the project ‘Into the skin, into the soul’, she developed bioplastic and ephemeral jewellery. With the challenge of creating an object that is an ephemeral experience and also generates the least environmental impact possible, bioplastic jewellery was a way to reconquer the body as the main interface of experience in the world. It is made of a biodegradable material she developed, offering a solution for the issue of conventional plastics.

This bioplastic was developed based on other biomaterials scientific research and open source research shared on the internet but adapted to the tools and materials to which the creator had access. It was entirely developed in a kitchen.

The gelatine bioplastic is light and flexible. The natural and original colour is yellow with transparency. When fabricated with tea, the yellow colour from gelatine will blend with the tea colour. It can assume different colours when pigments are combined with the yellowish base. When heated, the bioplastic is similar to a gel state and can be manipulated to transform into different shapes and textures. The material transforms into a solid state when it cools down and becomes more rigid as the water evaporates.

The amount of water and glycerine interferes with the flexibility of the material. Higher amounts of glycerine result in a more flexible material. Lower quantities results in a more rigid bioplastic. The thickness of the material can also represent different flexibility. A bioplastic with the same material proportions can be more flexible with a lower thickness and a higher thickness would be rigid. It can be recyclable, applying warm and water, and also reused.","Biobased, Other naturals, bioplastic",Variable,50-100%,Closed,Variable,Soft,Medium,Moderate,Moderate,Unknown,Unknown,Moderate,Moderate,Medium,Poor,Yes

Due to its closed pore surface, GetaCore is easy to clean and hygienic. It may be thermoformed and is notable for achieving visually seamless joint connections.

A particular advantage of GetaCore is its workability. GetaCore is self-supporting and can be thermoformed to create seamless corner connections, for example. It can also be drilled, cut, ground and milled by all common tools used for the processing of hardwoods. Cut sheets may be glued with an adhesive in the colour of the board design, resulting in an invisible joint after grinding. And as a homogenous material, GetaCore features an even colour across its entire cross-section. It therefore looks the same in cross-section as on both sides of its finished surface. With its homogenous colour and ability to form visually seamless joints, GetaCore can create the effect of large, single-piece units and surfaces. GetaCore can, for example, be molded into free-form desk surfaces, kiosks, sinks and basins. It has even been used to create a single-piece altar for a church.

Durability is another distinguishing characteristics of this material. GetaCore solid surface is resistant to a wide range of acids and alkaline solutions, while shallow surface damage can be relatively easily sanded away. Combined with its non-porous and hygienic properties, GetaCore is used widely in kitchens, bathrooms, hospitals and other hygienically sensitive areas.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/glare/,Glare,Metals,MET202,Netherlands,Fibre Metal Laminates Centre of Competence,"GLARE is a “GLAss-REinforced” Fibre Metal Laminate (FML), composed of several very thin layers of metal (usually aluminium) interspersed with layers of glass-fibre “pre-preg”, bonded together with a matrix such as epoxy.

The uni-directional pre-preg layers may be aligned in different directions to suit the predicted stress conditions. Although GLARE is a composite material[1], its material properties and fabrication are very similar to bulk aluminum metal sheets.

It has far less in common with composite structures when it comes to design, manufacture, inspection or maintenance. GLARE parts are constructed and repaired using mostly conventional metal material techniques. Its major advantages over conventional aluminium are: Better “damage tolerance” behaviour (especially impact and metal fatigue) Better corrosion resistance Better fire resistance Lower specific weight

Furthermore, it is possible to “tailor” the material during design and manufacture such that the number, type and alignment of layers can suit the local stresses and shapes throughout the aircraft.

This allows the production of double-curved sections, complex integrated panels or very large sheets, for example. While a simple manufactured sheet of GLARE will be more expensive than an equivalent sheet of aluminium, considerable production savings can be made using the aforementioned optimization.

A structure properly designed for GLARE will be significantly lighter and less complex than an equivalent metal structure, and will require less inspection and maintenance and enjoy a much longer lifetime-till failure, making it a cheaper, lighter and safer option overall.

This shape made it possible to bond them together in circular rows of blocks and, thus, create the cylindrical shape of the monument. One block alone weights 8.4 kilograms, measures 200 by 300 millimeters and is 70 millimeters thick. SCHOTT was selected to be the manufacturer of these glass components. To ensure timely execution of the project, a melting tank for manufacturing the 15,600 glass blocks was reserved early on at the SCHOTT site in Grünenplan. The proven high temperature stability of borosilicate glass was also important. After all, according to the specifications, the material had to be capable of standing up to the extreme changes in climate Madrid often faces.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/glass-colors/,Glass Colors,Glass,GLA180,Italy,Riverstone,"Glass Colors is an agglomerate of glass fragments and colored resin. The surface is treated with a waterproof wax coating that protects the material against stains and allows easy maintenance. The level of liquid absorption is zero. If the surface comes into contact with strongly-colored or acid substances such as coffee, cola, oil, lemon, etc., cleaning with a damp cloth is recommended. Glass Colors tiles are laid on a self-leveling compact substrate using specific adhesives. Used as either flooring or wall covering, spacing of at least 1-1.5mm is required for the 40×40 cm formats and 2 mm for larger formats. The spaces are filled with standard tile grouting in the color closest to that of the resin. Diamond slitting wheels are needed for dry or wet tile cutting. For border shaping, standard diamond tools for marble are used for wet cutting. Slight curving of the larger formats (40×40 cm, 60×40 cm, 60×60 cm, 110×30.5 cm) and sheets can occur, which is dependent upon the material flexibility. It is recommended that the tiles or sheets are spread on a flat surface and held in this position for at least 2 hours before lying. The tiles are sectioned but not corrected and therefore there can be slight deviations in the layout dimensions compared to the nominal dimensions (ISO Standard Tolerance +/- 1mm for formats of less than 60×60 cm, +/- 2mm for larger formats). For post-laying and day-to-day cleaning, neutral products should be used. Never use acid or scale prevention products as these can render the material surface opaque. If worn, bettering can be performed with Scotch-Brite brushes or disks, cloth disks and marble polishing cream or wax. For shower base fitting and related coverings, waterproofing of the substrate is necessary and for up to mid-height of the walls. To lay Glass Colors on heated substrates, the spacing indicated above must be increased by approximately 1mm and a latex-based plasticizer added to the adhesive used. Given the highly fragile nature of glass, the edges and corners of the tiles, which for obvious aesthetic reasons are straight cut (not beveled), may prove slightly rounded. This characteristic remains practically invisible after grouting.

The plastic is extremely durable and strong, and can be used both for interior and outside uses. It is a non slip material, maintenance free, and rot-proof.

The production process starts with the selection of high-grade raw materials to produce high-quality products. The raw material consists of 100% plastic recycled material (HDPE, LDPE and PP in a specific proportion). The PE-PP raw material is mixed with dye and other additives to improve and strengthen the product. This blend is melted into a homogenous mass under high temperature and sprayed into moulds. These moulds are cooled down, after which the boards are automatically pushed out. The final profiles can be sawn to size after 48 hours.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/gradient-2/,Gradient,Other naturals,ONA549,Netherlands,Buro BELÉN,"This very special textile has a wooden core and is embroidered with a black yarn in a various ways. The result is a textile with a gradient effect.

The inspiration for this material lies in Tonga, an island in the South Pacific. Here, one of the oldest handicrafts for producing textiles, called tapamaking, is still being practiced. The basis for this ancient handicraft is the cambium of the paper mulberry tree, a thin layer of fibers between the bark and the wood of the tree.

After harvesting the tree, Tongan women soak the cambium to beat the fibers to small cloths. During this process, they only use hardwood tools and a minimal amount of water. They then glue different cloths together using the starch of potatoes. In this way they create tapa, a soft and flexible wooden cloth which Tongans use for rituals like weddings and funerals. These wooden cloths have a fascinating beauty but lack the practical qualities needed for contemporary use. That is why buro BELÉN enriches these wooden cloths through industrial European techniques of textile processing.

First, the wooden cloths are embroidered with threads of silk from the mulberry silkworm, which eats the leaves of the tree. This treatment gives the wooden cloths the firmness of textile. Then, they are washed to dissolve the adhesive starch. Finally, there is the possibility to dye them with natural colours. Through this process, ancient craft and modern industry come together to give this new material the right textile qualities for contemporary use.","Curious, Sense & Sensibility, Other naturals",Matte,0%,Open,Medium,Soft,Warm,Moderate,None,Poor,Moderate,Poor,Moderate,Light,Poor,Yes

https://materialdistrict.com/material/grip-metal/,GRIP Metal,Metals,MET240,Canada,NUCAP Industries,"The GRIP Metal material is trademarked, thin gauge sheet metal with thousands of mechanically extruded hooks which allow mechanical bonding to nearly any other material.

Manufacturing is possible with nearly any coiled metal, from 0.3 mm to 10 mm thick. Processing happens at a rate of about 5 m per minute. During the pressing, the hooks are continuously formed as an integral part of the base metal. The ‘sticky’ metal is available in a wide range of materials and sizes and is intended to be a cost-effective manufacturing solution for metal-clad laminates and bonded panels. The sheets provide durability with or without the use of adhesives. Acting like ‘metal Velcro’, it distributes the attachment load over a wide area and many contact points. Products made with this connective system have very high strength to weight ratios and the durability and stiffness of metal. Added benefits are stronger, lighter bonds for cost effective products.

The hooks can be formed on nearly all types of metal (brass, copper, aluminium, steel, etc.) with thickness ranging from 0.3 mm to 0.94 mm. The hooks are available in both mini and standard sizes, and can be processed on either one or both sides of a metal. This provides the flexibility to use single sided GRIP Metal as an outer layer or attachment material or dual sided as inner core for multiple layer materials.

The line of construction products by Fiberline Composites offers profiles, gratings, planks and brackets. Products can be supplied individually and unmachined, or machined according to customer specifications. They can also be supplied ready for on-site installation.

As construction materials, fibreglass-reinforced plastics have numerous advantages: – corrosion and weather resistance: Resistant to UV, salt water and chemicals – low weight combined with great strength: Low weight means low costs for transportation and assembly, smaller foundations and easier handling – good thermal properties and no heat bridges: For example, these properties can be utilized to integrate the facade in the bearing structure of a building, making it visible both inside and outside. – minimal maintenance and long service life: Structures in fibreglass-reinforced are not affected by rain, salt or frost, requiring only cosmetic maintenance. Maintenance costs are therefore lower than costs for similar structures in traditional materials such as concrete, steel and wood. – rapid machining and assembly: The material machines as easily and quickly as wood with the use of either special equipment or ordinary tools, the low weight making machining and assembly entirely uncomplicated.

With the HEK-200 Haptic Evaluation Kit, haptic designers can evaluate how piezoelectrics can fulfill their haptic feedback requirements.

In comparison with conventional magnetic actuators, piezoelectric haptic actuators are able to create a richer haptic experience as they allow single cycles, fast start-up, static deflection, and independent frequency, amplitude, and phase control capabilities, thus allowing the user to control the feel and intensity of the sensation. SHIVR piezoelectric haptic actuators consist of high-performance piezos that are packed into a protective skin with pre-attached leads, making them hermetically sealed, electrically insulated and robust. The built in electrical connection has the capability of providing multi-touch point arrays and provides a wide range of termination options making them easy to integrate into any system while providing the broadest array of haptic effects

All hemp is sourced within 100 miles of the factory from local farmers. After the hemp is collected, a soy-based adhesive is used to bind full-length fibre hemp stalks. After the hemp stalks and soy-based adhesive are combined, the material is compressed and baked to form HempWood® Blocks.

From the Blocks, 4mm HempWood® veneers are cut for the top layer of the engineered flooring. For the substrate, a 5-layer PureBound® Hardwood Plywood is used. The plywood is sourced from Columbia Forest Products, which is located in West Virginia.

After cutting the veneers and ripping the plywood, the flooring is assembled with the help of PUR glue. After adhering the HempWood® veneer to the Purebond® Plywood, a tongue and groove profile is cut into the flooring. The tongue and groove profile and engineered format allows for ease of installation on both wood and concrete subfloors. HempWood® Flooring can be installed by nail down, glue down, or floating.

HempWood® Natural Flooring is safe with ultra-low VOCs due to HempWood’s no-added formaldehyde soy-based adhesive. The engineered format offers ease of installation, multiple subfloor applications, and the ability to be refinished up to four times. HempWood® Natural Flooring has a Janka Hardness Rating of 2,200 lbf, which is 20% harder than American white oak. The flooring is also CARB 2 and TSCA VI Compliant.

Growing between two to five metres, the strands are incredibly long and strong. Jute is the second most-cultivated textile fibre in the world, but is mainly used in the background, like for the backing of carpets and linoleum, or as potato sacks. Industrial processing and chemical treatment destroy the natural qualities of this ecological material and it tends to be used in utilitarian cloth like cargo sacking. With his project, designer Alexander Marinus aims to change the perception and appreciation of jute in textiles. He uses the full properties of the raw jute fibres in their pure state, preferably the light coloured thin fibres.

The first application Marinus developed was a cushion of 3.5 metres long, the average length of a jute fibre. Additionally, the material is perfectly suitable for needle felting, obtaining the structure of fur.

In addition to the economic significance that high-quality jute production can have for the regions where it is grown and processed (mainly India and Bangladesh), Hey Jute also seems to give an appropriate answer to the need for materials that do not require any added chemical elements, grow in a clean way (jute grows in a single monsoon season and does not require additional irrigation, fertilisation or insecticides) and can be reused.","Biobased, Other naturals, fabric, jute, nonwoven",Matte,0%,Open,Smooth,Soft,Warm,Moderate,None,Moderate,Good,Moderate,Moderate,Light,Moderate,Yes

In all cases, the bricks display varying colours, or veins of different colours, throughout the individual bricks.

Himalayan salt bricks are cut from pure crystal seams found in the Himalayas. When cut, the salt bricks are semi-translucent and range in colour from very light pink to deep orange and red. But it is the mineral composition of these bricks that really make them unique as building materials. Salt is a natural ionizer which means that as a material, it fosters the exchange of negative ions, or anions. When used in an interior environment, the salt blocks therefore lead to ion exchange, which helps to clean the surrounding air as well as create a bacteria-free environment. Additionally, this process assists in regulating water and blood pressure throughout the body.

Its distinctive profile depth and seamless installation system offer flexibility for a wide range of architectural applications.

Defined Lines and Natural Character Manufactured from thermally modified HOTwood ash, the Uni line 65 QC features a 65 mm profile depth, contributing to a clear linear appearance on façades. The material’s natural variation in colour and texture enhances the visual interest of the cladding, while its clean geometry allows for both uniform and mixed-profile designs, including perpendicular elements for added contrast.

Simplified, Reversible Installation The cladding is installed using the Grad® QuickClip® system, which includes aluminium joists with pre-mounted clips. This system allows the profiles to be attached without visible fasteners, maintaining a consistent finish. A recent improvement enables perpendicular profiles to be connected via grooved aluminium blocks, without the use of glue, nails or screws.

Designed with reversibility in mind, the Uni line 65 QC can be disassembled using dedicated Grad® disassembly keys, allowing components to be reused. This approach contributes to more circular building practices and simplifies maintenance or design updates.

Durable and Certified Material HOTwood ash is thermally modified without chemical treatment, improving the timber’s dimensional stability and resistance to weathering. The wood is PEFC-certified and serves as an alternative to tropical hardwoods in external applications, such as façades, soffits, and outdoor detailing.

Design Flexibility The 65 mm profile depth offers clear structural lines that can be applied in various orientations. Designers may choose to combine the Uni line 65 QC with contrasting colours or finishes, such as pre-weathered profiles, to achieve different visual outcomes.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/ht-coating-for-ceramic-tiles/,HT coating for ceramic tiles,Ceramics,CER126,Germany,Agrob Buchtal,"HT coating for ceramic tiles by Agrob Buchtal is especially developed with three properties in mind: to make surfaces easier to clean, anti-bacterial and odeur-repellent. The HT coating is based on the photocatalytic properties of titanium dioxide as a catalyst, which effects a reaction between light, oxy-gen and air humidity. The coating is not simply applied by spraying or any other “cold” method, but baked onto the glaze at high temperature in-plant. Compared to con-ventional sealing, impregnating or coating methods, HT is so robust that it can be used not only for wall but also for floor tiles. Tiles with HT are hydrophilic, i.e. “water-friendly“ and thus easy to clean. The water is not repelled, but spreads to form a thin film on the surface. In this way, dirt is washed down and can be easily removed. On facades rainwater forms a thin film which infiltrates dirt and thus causes a self-washing effect. HT has also an antibacterial effect: the photocatalysis produces activated oxygen, which decomposes microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, algae, moss and germs and prevents the formation of new pathogenes. HT eliminates unwelcome or harmful odours (interior and exterior), e.g. formaldehyde, tobacco or the exhaust fumes produces by industry or cars: a HT facade surface of 1000 m&sup2; cleans the air as effectively as 70 deciduous trees.",Ceramics,Glossy,0%,Open,Smooth,Hard,Medium,Poor,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Medium,Good,No

The material is hollow and contains air and millions of microscopic fibres that bind the surfaces together. The unique structure of the individual fibres makes the material strong and light, yet very formable using a conventional metal press or hydro forming tools. Unlike conventional lightweight sandwich materials, Hybrix can be shaped into compound curves, such as organic forms, or the shape of a moulded briefcase. The look, feel and behaviour of Hybrix is very similar to conventional metal sheet, but it weighs less than half as much.

Lamera supplies both complete, assembled components and flat Hybrix sheets, to the customers’ specifications. Market applications include aircraft and train interiors, automotive, med tech, shipping, architecture, consumer goods as well as other weight sensitive markets.

Owned partially by Midroc New Technology, Duroc, Chalmers University and a number of private investors, the spin-off company Lamera builds on Hybrix composite technology. Lamera focuses on design and weight oriented customers who demand high surface quality and low weight, such as companies within aircraft/railway/Automotive and other weight sensitive markets as well as producers of exclusive consumer goods.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/hygroscopic-mortar/,Hygroscopic Mortar,Concretes,CON190,Spain,LOOP DISSENY I CIRCULARITAT,"Developing a new material is always a stimulating challenge. It is not about inventing something. The main objective is to combine pre-existing materials in such a way that the final result guarantees performance in accordance with the intended use. This is the case with the use of ceramics as a recovered by-product so that it can have a new life cycle.

Thinking of ceramics as the element to be bonded, while respecting the concepts of zero kilometre products and the circular economy, for the remaining components of this new life cycle it is necessary to study the relationship between ceramics, stone materials as compatible aggregates and natural cement as a binder (or a cement with a low environmental impact), all of which can be found in Mallorca.

The result is an aggregate that has high hygroscopic properties with a resistance suitable for use in different solutions for construction, building and renovation, and, although the use of ceramic material limits the structural performance of paving stones for traffic and heavy loads, the great hygroscopic and draining properties of this material allows a high level of water filtration and lets water to naturally seep into the ground, or be captured and retained in lower layers for subsequent reuse or controlled drainage.

In this way, paving stones can serve as environmentally friendly surfaces for pedestrian networks and non-motorised road traffic, both in terms of their relationship with the natural environment with regard to their constituent materials and in terms of their properties once they have been installed until the end of their useful life cycle.

The carbon footprint of the resulting material is low impact, since it is made up of a high percentage of stone materials with an almost zero CO2 emissions footprint, along with other materials that are obtained from the reuse of ceramic products with no further processing. The binder used contains either natural cements or low environmental impact cements in quantities that in no case exceed 15% of the total material.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/hyper-wood/,Hyper Wood,Other naturals,ONA997,United Kingdom,Teodoro Rava,"As reclaimed materials gain traction in design, there is an underlying skepticism about the efficacy of biomaterials in the realm of design. Teodoro Rava confronts this apprehension in Hyper Wood, recognising the limitations of current bio composites approach by defining a new material identity through innovative processes.

At the heart of Rava’s vision is the Hyper Wood material. The project disrupts the conventional understanding of wood as an entirely natural form. Reclaimed fibres create a wood-like material, forging a new life for the waste matter. Drawing inspiration from the growth pattern of trees, the project replicates the intricate structure of timber and, in the process, blurs the boundary between natural and man-made materials.

Teodoro’s project critically examines the overuse of wood and proposes an alternative vernacular— a customisable solid matter from existing waste streams rather than logging practices. Rava highlights the urgency for solutions to meet the increasing demand for natural products and a shift towards regenerative and circular approaches.

Hyper Wood does not intend to substitute a material, but rather create new material range that borrows the language from the natural world. The raw material production reclaims discarded fibre from paper mills and mixes it with binders obtained from discarded food peels.

Hyper Wood suggests a future where materials are both regenerative and enriching and urges a reconsideration of authenticity in the context of biophilia. The material process and conception detach the notion of autochthony from nativeness. Rava encourages viewing nativeness as a dynamic process, aligning with ongoing cultural, social, and environmental interactions.

The weathered yet indestructible barns, which were built in the nineteenth century, have lost their true purpose because of the modernization of the farms. As such, many barns are being destroyed. The Canadian government has decided that these beautiful and historical buildings are cultural heritage and therefore one barn per farm must be kept, however the cladding of the other torn down barns is being retrieved by companies such as the Netherlands based Barn in the City. They then enhance and protect the barnwood with a transparent or a semi-transparent coating. This results in a glossy ‘iced’ or matte ‘frosted’ look, adding depth to the grain structure of the wood. The wood used is white pine and hemlock, in their natural colours, or with traces of paint. Available colours are grey, brown, black, red smooth, red weathered, green smooth, green weathered and white smooth.

The batt is hold together with bonding fibres. It is manufactured in a dry process with low energy consumption in a modern factory in Älvdalen, Sweden.

iCell Skiva is an excellent insulation against cold and heat thanks to low heat conductivity and high air flow resistance stopping convection. At the same time the insulation attenuates unwanted sounds and noise efficiently thanks to its structure and high density. The cellulose fibre has hygroscopic properties so that moisture in air is taken up and given away. That makes the building breathe, moisture is dried out without condensation.

The batts are easy to install thanks to their form stability, the ease of cutting them to size, and that they do not irritate your skin or your respiratory tract.

Assessments iCell Skiva is registered at BASTA (SE) and SundaHus Material Data. Construction Product Declaration is given as eBVD with Swedish Association of Construction Product Companies (Byggmaterialindustrierna).

Fire Natural products, such as cellulose, have a by nature lower fire classification. They catch fire more easily than material made from glass or rock. However, iCell’s fire resistance can outperform glasswool in a construction. In combination with Swisspearl Windstopper we achieve a 60-minute fire resistance. EL60, EW60 and E60.

The maximum height is limited by handling and static reasons only. In general the mesh elements are tensioned from top to bottom. Different mounting systems are available with regard to the specifics of each project.

By attaching slim LED-profiles to the reverse side of the wire mesh the homogenous and transparent look of the façade is maintained at all times, even when the LEDs are not in use.

Both indoor and outdoor façades may be embellished with medium to high resolution video and graphic animation. Imagic Weave offers all of the benefits of an LED imaging solution within a plug’n’play stainless steel mesh system.

Furthermore it allows easy connection and fast setup times. The Imagic Weave System is auto-addressable and optimised for both standards DMX and DVI.

Already in 1907 the phenomenon of light emittance by electrical stimulance of a solid mass was discovered by H.J. Round. He connected a Silicium Carbide Cristal (SiC) intended for the detection of radio waves, with an electrical current. The result was called “cold” light, because no heat could be measured while the light was emitted. This discovery was however regarded as not very interesting; the researchers were only interested in the detection of radio waves! It was only in 1921 that O.V. Lossew discovered this light emittance again. He researched the light emitting phenomenon from 1927 to 1942 and was able to manipulate the frequency of the light with mirrors. He intended to use the light in combination with the mirrors for sending messages. In 1935 G. Destriau discovered a similar effect of SiC with Zinc Sulfide (ZnS), but untill 1951 scientists were not able to explain how this Lossew-effect was created. For this, the discovery and development of transistor technology was necessary. Transistors made it possible to continue the research of the Destriau and Lossew effects, with which it became possible to create flat screens as a replacement for Cathodic based screens. While a breakthrough with the ZnS was not reached, the discovery of III-V connections known as semi-conductors did create a breakthrough.This discovery resulted in the first use of one light-emitting cristal based on -Galliumarsenidcum (GaAs) Galliumphospor (GaP) in 1962.",Glass,Satin,0%,Open,Smooth,Hard,Medium,Poor,None,Unknown,Good,Good,Good,Medium,Moderate,No

https://materialdistrict.com/material/inner-skins/,Inner Skins,Other naturals,ONA617,Germany,Studio Gutedort,"Inner skins asks the question of whether or not we can overcome stereotypical aesthetics and appreciate beauty for its appearance: how can we change our habitual perception? Based on experimental material research, inner skins from sheep, pigs and cows, animal entrails like bladders and intestines that are usually considered as unappealing and disposed of as special waste, are now used to create unique and beautiful objects. If the skins are considered honestly, their unprecedented form and uncommon leathery surface reveal their hidden value. An elaborate vegetable tanning process transforms the material into leather which serves as a primary material for distinctive objects that no longer need to deny their origins.

Working process First, the innards are thoroughly cleaned of conjoined fat layers and blood inclusions. Then they are acidified with constant agitation in a liquor of dilute formic acid. For this purpose a mechanically operated barrel with wood knobs inside is used. Thus, the skin is well tumbled. Once the inner skins have reached the correct pH-value they are attached to strings and hung in the vegetable tan liquor. This is the dissolved tannin from the bark of acacia mimosa from Brazil as well as bark and trunk of the quebracho tree from Argentina. Initially the concentration of tanning agent in the liquor is still very low, but it is increased gradually. Therefore, a uniform and continuous tanning of the skins is guaranteed.

To see the progress of the tanning process, you have to cut the leather because it can only be seen in the cross-section whether the skins are completely tanned or not. Depending on the thickness of the inner skins and the liquor concentration, the tanning process takes between one and two months. After tanning, the material can now be treated with different methods. When the brownish colour of bark tanning is desired, the skins are washed and lubricated with three different fats in the tanner barrel. Through oiling, the leather gets soft and flexible. Subsequently, the innards must be acidified again to fix the fats.

If colouring is desired, the procedure is much more complex. Depending on the desired hue and intensity of colour up to two dyeing processes with previous oiling and acidification as well as subsequent oiling and thorough washing are necessary.

The drying plays an important role in the manufacturing process. The longer the leather is kneaded, the softer and more flexible it gets. To preserve the original shape of the innards, the individual parts are manually kneaded and pulled until they are dry.","Biobased, Curious, Other naturals",Matte,0%,Closed,Coarse,Resilient,Warm,Good,,Moderate,Moderate,Poor,Moderate,Light,Moderate,Yes

To get good colouring results the alloy has to have a minimum content of 50% iron and 17% of chromium. On stainless steel with a chromium content between 13 and 17% only a reduced range of colours can be achieved, predominantly brown and grey. There are limitations in maximum content of other alloy components. Best results are obtained on austenitic stainless steels.

Relatively high standards are set with regard to homogeneity of structure and alloy concerning the surface quality of the material to be coloured. Only first quality material provides uniformly coloured surfaces.

On austenitic and ferritic stainless steels with a chromium content of at least 17% the following colours can be achieved:Bronze, cobalt-blue, steel-blue, gold, champagne, red, green, anthracite and black. Due to the mechanism of lightwave interference which generates the colours, stainless steel surface especially when coloured red and green show changes in colour depending on the angle under which they are looked at. This effect should be taken into account for actual application. Proven standardised colours are bronze, cobalt-blue, gold and black. Chemical and electrochemical processes of surface treatment like pickling, etching and electropolishing which affect the surface of stainless steel will destroy the coloured surface. Therefore these processes can be used for application of letters and patterns into coloured stainless steel. For that purpose the areas in which the coloured surface is to be preserved are masked by an acid-resistant resist (photoresist, screen-printing or offset printing resist) and subsequently the areas not so prepared are discoloured.","Sense & Sensibility, Metals",Glossy,0%,Closed,Smooth,Hard,Medium,Moderate,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Medium,Moderate,No

The composite is made of more than 60% of recycled shellfish and a natural mineral binder without petrochemicals.

The production process is hand-crafted and low-tech, where more than 80% of the work is hand-made and does not require any firing (air drying). Malàkio makes unique or mass-produced objects with a very low GHG footprint from this composite material made from local raw materials. The material can be worked with classic carpentry tools and techniques, but ideally with stone blades. It can be drilled, screwed or cut. Machining with a CNC milling machine remains delicate in terms of the quality of the finish, as shell fragments may come off when the milling machine passes over them, but can be good for some applications.

The visual aspect of the creations can be customized according to the shells, grinding dimensions, percentage of shells used (between 60 and +80%), natural pigments added or the desired finish (polished, varnish used, etc.).

The design allows Malàkio to create and manufacture pieces of various sizes and shapes from small lifestyle objects and tableware to furniture (shop counters, table tops, shelves, TV stands) without the need to invest in expensive steel moulds. This aspect offers the advantage of refined and custom-made creations that can be produced in shorter periods of time.

This represents a reduction of up to 95 per cent in embodied carbon compared to conventional bricks, based on data from the Brick Development Association’s Environmental Product Declaration (2019–2024).

The manufacturing process is fully circular—raw materials are locally sourced from waste streams, and the resulting bricks are both recyclable and reusable at the end of their life.

Kenoteq also offers a bespoke colour and shape development service, enabling K-BRIQ® to be tailored to specific project requirements. Standard colour options include tones such as Gillespie Magenta, Heriot Mustard, Watt Brown, Medero Grey, Chapman Burnt Orange, and Gullane Cyan.

To date, the use of K-BRIQ® has resulted in the repurposing of over 440,000 kilograms of waste and the saving of more than 87,000 kilograms of CO₂e. Its production requires only 10 per cent of the energy used to manufacture traditional clay bricks.

The brick is certified by the British Board of Agrément (BBA, Agrément Certificate 25/7367), supporting its use in both exterior and interior applications across a wide range of construction projects. Its technical and aesthetic performance aligns with industry requirements while offering a substantially improved environmental profile.","Recycling, Sustainable, Concretes, bricks, facades",Matte,0%,Closed,Coarse,Hard,Cool,Moderate,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Medium,Moderate,No

It is made of Keratine, also known as sheep wool. Keratine is a renewable, ecological and secondary natural resource. It has the benefit that it eliminates unwanted gases by means of a chemical reaction. This effect will remain active for decades. Furthermore, it acts as a flame-spreading barrier because it has a nitrogen level of 16%, a relative moist level of 14 – 18% and a combustion temperature of 600 °C. Furthermore, Keratine is an endothermal material, meaning it requires more energy to let it burn, than it releases during burning. It has an oxygen index level of 25.2% meaning that for combustion of keratine, the level of oxygen should be at least 25%, while plain air consists of only 21% oxygen. The material purifies air and at the same time offers high acoustic absorption.

However, under certain circumstances it can take decades for a uniform silver-grey patina to devel-op, like those seen on mountain huts in the Alps. Untreated wood facades change their colour and surface structure depending on environmental influences. Determining when the effect may be achieved is difficult, as many factors have an influence on various building surfaces.

With KEIM Lignosil-Verano, a silicate-based surface treatment has been developed that simulates a naturally beautiful, patinised wood appearance from the very first day. As a result of consciously leaving out the protective function which is usually desirable in coatings, the applied Lignosil-Verano coat increasingly changes to natural colour over the course of time.

KEIM Lignosil-Verano KEIM Lignosil-Verano is a silicate colouring stain for limited dimensionally stable and non-dimensionally stable exterior wood components. KEIM Lignosil-Verano simulates a greyed, patinated surface, as it results from several years of weathering on natural wood. KEIM Lignosil-Verano is subject to natural ageing and thus equalises the visual differences that can arise from uneven weathering of exposed and protected surfaces on uncoated wood.

KEIM Lignosil-Verano is awarded with Cradle to Cradle Certified® Silver and C2C Certified Material Health Certificate™ Gold.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/kepla-coat/,Kepla-coat,Coatings,COA114,Taiwan,"Techplasma Technology Co.,Ltd","KEPLA-COAT® is a white coloured, plasma chemical coating that improves aluminium and titanium alloys. The coating has high corrosion resistance and excellent abrasion resistance.

KEPLA-COAT® layers applied to aluminium consist of up to 60 percent of corundum. The remaining layer components are mainly Al2O3 and boehmite. Depending on the alloy of the coated workpiece, KEPLA-COAT® can reach a thickness of up to 150 μm. KEPLA-COAT® provides not only excellent wear protection, but also perfect uniform layer, dimensional accuracy and hardness. KEPLA-COAT®-coated substrates have a high fatigue strength. These layers can resist aggressive gases such as chlorine and boron trichloride and a layer thickness of 30 μm, for instance, shows a corrosion resistance of more than 3,000 hours in the salt fog test according to DIN EN ISO 9227. In addition, KEPLA-COAT® ensures extremely good anti-friction properties in combination with PTFE or other dry lubricants.

KEPLA-COAT®-coated aluminum components have a wide variety of applications, including geometrically high-precision rotors in turbo molecular pumps. In this case, the component coating layer, being without any cracks or pores, prevents the infiltration of reaction gases and it provides the necessary protection for plasma etching processes while resisting the mechanical stress generated by the extremely high rotation speed. KEPLA-COAT®-coated aluminum components are used, among other things, as sealing gaskets, fixing discs, cylinders, drums or cylindrical tubes.

Coating takes place in a saline solution electrolyte. The component is connected in series to an external source of electricity and acts as an anode. During anodization oxygen plasma discharges itself on the component surface and briefly melts the surface thus forming 2 oxide ceramic layers that bond tightly with the outer metallic layer. A barrier layer with a thickness of about 100 nm constitutes the direct bond with the aluminium or titanium component. Then come an oxide ceramic layer with low porosity density followed by one with high porosity density. This layer bond protects the aluminium and titanium against wear and corrosion and, thanks to its surface structure, it allows the absorption of lubricants as well as following component treatments such as, for instance, paintwork or impregnation.

KEPLA-COAT® Black can be used to coat all commonly used aluminium- and titanium-based materials. The coating has high light absorption and increases the heat conductivity. The usual layer thickness values lie within the 5 to 15 μm range for aluminium-based materials and at 50 μm for titanium-based materials. Owing to the layer’s crystalline structure the base material’s fatigue strength is only slightly affected. KEPLA-COAT® Black is suitable for optical components, high-precision screw threads or heating radiators. This coating is used in sectors like vacuum technology, microelectronics and the aviation and space industry.",Coatings,Matte,0%,Open,Medium,Hard,Medium,Poor,None,Good,Good,Good,Moderate,Light,Poor,No
https://materialdistrict.com/material/keraion/,KerAion,Ceramics,CER175,Germany,Agrob Buchtal,"Used worldwide for decades, the KerAion facade system offers – besides low weight and special fastening technique – alternatives to the otherwise quite usual board formats. In addition to rectangular panels, square panels in the large formats of 60 x 60 cm, 90 x 90 cm and 120 x 120 cm are available, which are particularly suitable for the facade design of big buildings. All versions and formats have received the general approval of the construction supervisory authority and have also proven themselves in the case of a statically demanding building structure.

A high degree of creative freedom is ensured by the colour range. Based on SpectraView, nine colour families are matched to each other and several contrasting colours. The colour range is completed by the “Design glazed” colours.

KerAion panels can be installed both with visible and invisible fastening. KerAion Quadro, with a weight per unit area of 18.5 kg/m² and a thickness of 8 mm, is mounted either by means of clasps (in case of the standard dimensions of 60 x 60 cm and 60 x 90 cm) or bearing profile (formats 60 x 120 cm, 90 x 90 cm, 90 x 120 cm and 120 x 120 cm). KerAion K8 (standard dimensions of 60 x 60 cm, 60 x 90 cm, 90 x 90 cm) – also 8 mm thin and with a weight of 18 kg/m² – is designed for fastening by means of clamps. Optionally, safety tapes are available for all formats. These safety tapes are applied in-plant to the panel’s reverse side and prevent larger pieces from falling down if a panel is damaged.

Architects attaching importance to a particularly uniform joint pattern MAY decide in favour of KerAion® Quadro, which features invisible fastening by means of clasps or bearing profiles (depending on the panel size). In addition, the system offers the advantage that a weakening of the facade panels by undercut anchors is avoided. KerAion® K8 with visible clamp fastening – with the colour of the clamp lips being matched to the design of the ceramic panel – offers other advantages: above all rapid installation with well thought-out system components, both on metal and wooden substructures.

HT coating – Ceramic facades activated by light.

Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is inseparably and durably baked onto the ceramic surface at high temperature. As catalyst, which is not used up, it effects a reaction activated by light (photocatalysis) with oxygen and air humidity practically for the life of a tile. In this way, activated oxygen and a hydrophilic, water-friendly ceramic surface is produced. The activated oxygen now fulfils two decisive functions:

1. Directly on the surface of the ceramics, it decomposes micro-organisms such as fungi, algae, moss or germs and inhibits their growth. Thus, the growth of algae and moss on facades is prevented, and time-consuming and expensive cleaning works are avoided. This saves considerable maintenance costs in the life cycle of a building.

2. Air pollutants such as, for example, nitrogen oxides from traffic or industry are considerably reduced. HT permanently improves the ambient air of the building.",Ceramics,Variable,0%,Closed,Medium,Hard,Medium,Moderate,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Medium,Good,No

Keralpor setter products are used as sintering aids in the production of a wide range of components including ceramics, fuel cells, powdered metals and dental devices.

Due to the porosity of the contained aluminium oxide, gases produced during the firing process can be easily diffused through Keralpor plates. When sintering products with high amounts of binder, debinding gases can be efficiently dispersed. This is advantageous as the successful sintering of components relies on a homogenous burn off of contained organic binders.

Due to Kerapor’s thinness (1.0 mm, 1.5 mm, 2.0 mm, or customised) and gross density (2.56 g/cm3), the plates are very lightweight. This serves to reduce strain on the kiln furniture set up. Additionally, due to the smooth surface and porous structure of these plates, adherence of the overlying green ware can be avoided. Keralpor is therefore especially suitable for sintering thin ceramic films such as Keraflex Porcelain tape (CER143).",Ceramics,,0%,Closed,Smooth,Hard,Medium,Poor,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Light,Good,No
https://materialdistrict.com/material/kerama-facade-cladding/,Kerama facade cladding,Plastics,PLA1477,Netherlands,Tholin Bouwproducten B.V.,"Kerama – Aura is a façade cladding system made from PVC, designed to combine the visual characteristics of timber with the performance benefits of a modern synthetic material. It is intended as a low-maintenance and weather-resistant solution for exterior applications, offering an alternative to traditional wooden cladding profiles such as Swedish rabat boards.

The product features a surface with pronounced relief and a high level of contrast, resulting in a visually distinctive appearance. It is available in two colour variations: a light oak tone that introduces a natural and understated aesthetic, and a deep black tone that provides a more contemporary, high-contrast finish. These options allow for a degree of visual flexibility across different architectural styles.

Kerama – Aura panels are available in three surface treatments and are developed to retain their appearance over time. Selected variants include UV-resistant coatings that help reduce discolouration from prolonged sun exposure. Due to the properties of PVC, the panels demonstrate high resistance to moisture, frost, and general weathering, making them suitable for use in variable climatic conditions.

In addition to their weather resistance, the panels contribute to acoustic performance, with good sound-insulating characteristics that can support a more comfortable interior environment. The product is also fire-resistant; the inclusion of mineral components in the formulation results in a non-combustible material classification, which may assist in meeting relevant safety requirements.

The system is designed to require minimal upkeep. Its durable surface finish means the panels do not require recoating, even after extended periods of exposure. This makes Kerama – Aura suitable for use in projects where long-term durability and limited maintenance are important considerations.

Kerama – Aura is manufactured primarily from PVC, supplemented by mineral fillers. While not a natural material, the inclusion of recycled content supports a degree of circularity. The cladding system is positioned for use in both residential and commercial construction, where a balance of visual consistency, environmental exposure resistance, and ease of maintenance is required.","Recycling, Plastics, facades",Matte,0%,Closed,Medium,Hard,Medium,Moderate,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Light,Moderate,No

And as diverse fastening alternatives ensure technical and constructional flexibility, this system offers the appropriate solution to every challenge – even on difficult bases.

Both variants, K20 and K18, are supplied in numerous formats, with KeraTwin K20 being available in greater lengths. As a facade system with the widest variety of colours, KeraTwin permits every architect to realize their creative ideas. Thus, besides the colour range “SpectraView” with nine colour families harmoniously matched to each other and contrasting colours, the colour systems “Natura unglazed”, “Design unglazed” and “Design glazed” are also available.

On request, the panels are also supplied with profiles which – due to their three-dimensional structure – can make large facades less monotonous and lend an entire building a distinctive character. The joints are realized in such a way that the construction is optimally protected against driving rain. With their relatively low weight of 32 kg/m², the panels are easy to transport and to install. The two KeraTwin variants essentially differ from each other with regard to the fastening, which depends on the requirements of the specific project. The vertical system rail K20, for example, offers an enormous freedom of design and an extensive range of accessories. As the panels are simply hung in the system rail, no additional tool is necessary for the mounting. An even faster and more efficient installation is possible with the innovative T-profile K20, which requires fewer individual components in the substructure. The vertical Omega profile K20 has proved itself as specialist for efficient installation on difficult bases, e.g. walls with post and beam construction, while the clamp system K20 permits the mounting of the panels not only in horizontal and vertical direction, but also on ceilings.

HT coating – Ceramic facades activated by light.

Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is inseparably and durably baked onto the ceramic surface at high temperature. As catalyst, which is not used up, it effects a reaction activated by light (photocatalysis) with oxygen and air humidity practically for a tile life long. In this way, activated oxygen and a hydrophilic, water-friendly ceramic surface are produced. The activated oxygen now fulfils two decisive functions:

1. Directly on the surface of the ceramics, it decomposes microorganisms such as fungi, algae, moss or germs and inhibits the growth. Thus, the growth of algae and moss on facades is inhibited, and time-consuming and expensive cleaning works are avoided. This saves considerable maintenance costs in the life cycle of a building.

2. Air pollutants such as, for example, nitrogen oxides from traffic or industry are considerably reduced. HT permanently improves the ambient air of the building.",Ceramics,Matte,0%,Closed,Medium,Hard,Medium,Moderate,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Medium,Good,No

The root of Kyoto Nishijin-ori goes back to some 1,200 years ago (AD 794), when it was woven as an extremely luxurious textile for the Imperial court nobles. The art of Nishijin-ori flourished, supported by the patronage of both the Imperial court and great Samurai lords. The weavers also continued to adapt to new technology. Today, you can see the art of Kyoto Nishijin-ori in the beautiful Japanese Kimono textile.

Tennâge is a patented wood veneer combining nature and the latest technology. The Tennâge flexible wood veneer is slit into 2 mm pieces for use as a vertical thread. Horizontal threads can be silk, cotton, polyester or any other materials. By using Tennâge as a vertical thread, a wider fabric/textile can be woven with an automatic high-speed machine. By changing the material, colour and size of the horizontal thread, Ki-ori Tennâge can have a different look even when using the same wood species.

Natural fibres of plant and animal origin offer comfort and are pleasant to the touch. They are a more sustainable and healthier alternative to synthetic polymer fibres as they are electrostatically neutral, airy, naturally elastic, durable, renewable, and biodegradable.

At KO-SI, they use only the best natural fibres from renewable sources and turn them into high-quality products tailored to customers’ and users’ needs. Each carefully selected raw material gives fibres with unique properties that affect the distinguishing characteristics of the final product.

All KO-SI natural-fibre pads are available in sheets or rolls in various thicknesses and dimensions.

COIR Coir (coconut fibre) is an ideal component in the living environment. The fibres, located in a fleshy sheath between the solid inner shell and the outer sheath of the coconut, are of natural origin, electrostatically neutral, hypoallergenic, and do not irritate the mucous membranes, skin, and respiratory tract.

Coir contains enclosed air cells that give the fibres excellent insulating ability and resistance to mold and moisture. As it does not burden the environment, coir is an excellent alternative to synthetic polymer fibres.

SISAL Sisal pads are an ideal padding material for objects subjected to frequent heavier loads.

Sisal fibres are solid, have a lovely sheen, and are creamy-white or light yellowish in color. Sisal fibres are an excellent moisture regulator and have the highest elongation value among natural plant fibres. They are very durable, so they provide strength and support to the final product.

The natural antistatic properties of sisal fibres contribute to greater comfort and well-being, which prevents discomfort often present with synthetic fibre products.

LYOCELL Lyocell fibres define a new standard of sustainability and natural comfort. Regenerated cellulose fibres of botanic origin are known for their softness and environmentally responsible production process.

Lyocell is very soft yet durable and strong. It is gentle on the skin, breathable, and a good moisture regulator.

Due to the unique physical properties of the fibre, lyocell is a great padding material for products, where good thermo-physiological properties of textiles are required. As they are hypoallergenic, lyocell fibres are especially suitable for people with allergies or sensitive mucous membranes.

WOOL Sheep wool is widespread natural material in the human environment. Its curly structure gives it a lot of airiness and softness. Because of its natural elasticity, it returns to its original state after pressure.

KO-SI wool pads are soft and an outstanding heat and moisture regulators. The material warms in winter and provides a pleasant feeling in summer, as it absorbs up to 35% water of its weight while still being dry to the touch.

Because wool is naturally antistatic and absorbs unpleasant odours, KO-SI wool pads are an excellent top layer in any mattress or upholstered furniture.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/kova-textiles/,Kova Textiles,Plastics,PLA841,United States,Kova Textiles LLC.,"Kova Textiles create uniquely textured solar window fabrics with vinyl coated polyester yarns and KovaLux proprietary filaments. When light passes through a Kova fabric, it dissolves into a diaphanous surface – sheer, yet not transparent – translucent, but not opaque. These textiles work well as wall hangings, room dividers or in any application where light, either natural or artificial, can pass through the fabric.

Kova Textiles was founded in 2004 by Libby and Greg Kowalski, a mother and son team of textile designer and design builder. With more than 20 years experience designing textiles, Libby Kowalski draws much of her inspiration from her family’s collection of crystal objects d’art. Prior to opening Kova Textiles, Libby researched and patented a water-clear polymer yarn that can be used commercially. Sparkling in the sunlight and reflecting incandescent light at night, her clear polymer yarn and textile patterns bring the glimmer of a crystal vase or chandelier to a flexible textile.

In addition to clear polymer yarns, Kova’s product line also incorporates coloured, opaque polymer yarns in a number of interesting fabric weaves and patterns that can be used for a number of different window and architectural applications. Kova offers four collections, each with its own specific textural and opacity characteristics. The Satin FR Collection is the most decorative group of fabrics. Woven on mill machinery, it features fabrics that combine a handcrafted look with the technological innovation of clear polymer yarn. The Sheer Collection was developed in response to the need for a lighter weight fabric for roller shades. The YaZa Collection responds to the need for slightly heavier fabrics for hotel and office environments and incorporates glints of silver, gold or copper, along with herringbone and Japanese-inspired basket weaves. The Plains Collection consists of three fabrics which can be used independently of the other fabrics, or in concert with them when more privacy is desired.

Kova fabrics pass the NFPA 701 test for flammability, are anti-microbial, demonstrate excellent lightfastness and are suitable for both residential and commercial applications.

These include packaging, greeting cards, electronic devices, household appliances, cosmetics, textiles, furniture, automotive parts, and numerous other items. These magnetic foils and holograms provide effective and attractive brand name protection, as well as increased security for businesses.

Cold foil technology can be flexibly integrated into any printing process as the cold foil is simply applied as a “fifth colour” to the print image. This opens up many new design possibilities. Overprinting offers free choice of colours. The base colour is usually silver. The cold foil can then be overprinted with any process colours or other colours. A variety of new metallic colour tones can also be created in this manner.

Interaction of ink and foil: Cold foiling allows precise registration, just as with offset printing. The foil can therefore be transferred in register with the printed image. Both the foil and the overprinted colours can be rasterized to produce novel colour and metallic effects. Cold foils offer a high gloss level, even for coarse rasters (25l/cm). The foil releases cleanly at surface coverages of 40 to 100%.

Design possibilities are virtually limitless and many effects can be achieved: filigree patterns, fine lines and lettering down to approx. 6 pt, any kind of partial coverage, full surface foil transfer, small recesses, half tones and screens and fine registration marks, e.g. crosshairs.

Holographic elements: Cold foils are also available in holographic designs. Large-area diffractive structures or single images can be selected. Besides shiny metallic foils, there are also a range of transparent holographic foils to choose from.

Digital manufacturing techniques and digital functions bring them a step closer towards automation in textile.

A very old but authentic textile is lace. Lace is a delicate fabric made of white yarns in an open structure. Labeledby tried to mimic this authentic look of lace, using a digital manufacturing technique: 3D printing. White tulle was used as base and 3D printed with a white filament on top of it. Labledby digitalised a lace pattern and printed this 2D pattern on top of the tulle. They used a semi flexible filament because they wanted to mimic the look but also the feel of lace; non stretchable but not too rigid as well.","Biodegradable, Sense & Sensibility, Plastics",Matte,50-100%,Open,Medium,Resilient,Medium,Poor,None,Moderate,Moderate,Poor,Poor,Light,Moderate,No
https://materialdistrict.com/material/lace-latex/,Lace & Latex,Other naturals,ONA728,Germany,Sara Linke,"Designer Sara Linke combines lace and latex to show off the aesthetics of latex. The material is made by covering or coating lace with liquid latex to create a closed fabric, so that the lace takes on the latex’ characteristic sheen. The lace can also be bedewed with latex to keep the open structure of the fabric. Depending on how the materials are combined, other characteristics may change as well. These can be manipulated in different ways.

If the open, wrap-knitted textiles are dipped in the latex, the transparency, drape and feel of the new fabric depend on the thickness of the layer. Thin coatings produce a soft, supple drape, and make the fabric shimmer as frosted glass. Thick layers increase the rigidity of the textile, giving it rubber-like properties and making it opaque.

Different colour effects can be produced by mixing in dyes in the process. If the used lace has stretch properties, this is maintained in the process.

The project aims to address this issue by repurposing pre-consumer wool waste through a bio-assembly process with mycelium-based composites.

The material research conducted as part of the Lana project includes the development of material prototypes, an experimental material-technology setup, and application demonstrators. These components showcase the potential applications of mycelium-based composites in the field of architecture. Additionally, the Lana project emphasizes the establishment of a synergies framework between local suppliers, connected to the manufacture of the proposed composite material.

All creations start as cut lava stones. In some cases the shapes are cut using a waterjet, and some of the designs are etched using sand blasting. This processing adds interest to the existing grain and texture of natural lava stone.

Lava Tiles can be further finished by applying a special glaze by hand and then firing the tiles at a high temperature.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/lava-tiles/,Lava tiles,Natural stones,NST099,Iceland,Tinna Gunnarsdóttir,"Lava fields cover large areas in Iceland. They are often rugged and impossible to cross, but occasionally the hot running lava is solidified into a big smooth surface reminiscent of a grand cathedral floor. It is a fascinating material in all its variety. Tinna likes to grasp this wild material and force it into geometrical shapes, which can then be used as a paving material. The lava tiles quickly get colonised by moss and other vegetation. The lava tiles have the size 40x40x2 cm and are made of Icelandic lava.

Iceland has a high concentration of active volcanoes due to its location on the mid-Atlantic Ridge, a divergent tectonic plate boundary, and also due to its location over a hot spot. The island has 30 active volcanic systems, of which 13 have erupted since the settlement of Iceland in AD 874. Of these 30 volcanic systems, the most active/volatile is Grímsvötn. Over the past 500 years, Iceland’s volcanoes have erupted a third of the total global lava output. Tinna Gunnardóttir is a conceptual designer located in Reykjavík, Iceland.

It is certified safe, locally produced, recycled recyclable and fire-resistant. It is both versatile and offers an infinite amount of creative capital.

Most of the time, the material Le Pavé® is composed of 100% plastic waste; all of which is made possible by SASMINIMUM’s patented thermocompression technique and a meticulous work of identification and characterisation of the different wastes.

The material is the foundation of everything, it will determine the aspect, the ecological impact but also the performance when used in projects. Thanks to their sourcing and recycling partners available throughout France, Le Pavé® is the ideal material for interior design projects, as a worktop or covering for example.

With Le Pavé®, each panel is unique, the aesthetics are the result of a unique process, which, like marble or wood, allows the substance of the material to express itself. For each project, SASMINIMUM defines the proportions beforehand: density of the material, type of chips, proportion of the colours in their palette… then randomness does the trick!

It looks ideal for various applications: furniture, office desk tops, worktops, wall cladding… Through SASMINIMUM’s creations, they demonstrate that it is possible to match waste to building materials.

The properties of the material Le Pavé®:

Hygienic Le Pavé® is a non-porous material. Its very smooth surface is guaranteed anti-stain and very easy to clean.

Massive Produced in the mass, Le Pavé® is shock resistant, it can be sanded and repaired.

Guarantee Le Pavé® is a material guaranteed for 2 years. It is constantly tested in independent laboratories.

This technology is based on the use of a cold curing pick-and-place process on transparent conductive plastics.

Products such as LED-embedded glass and LED headliner are possible with this technology. LED Film technology is usually used for glass products that have to be laminated for safety reasons, like laminated glass tables, balustrades and glass logo doors. Glass with embedded LEDs is even also used for media façades. LED Films can be based on a transparent conductive coating or based on a printed conductive coating. The main advantage of using a transparent coating is not only its transparency, but also the fact that film sizes of 3.5 m x 1.2 m can be achieved. Printed film can be used between 15 – 30 mA/LED. However, the size is usually limited to 0.75 m x 0.75 m. Transparent LED Films are produced on customer design request.

The LED Light Sheet is based on a thin PMMA (acrylic) sheet. The lighting panel is characterised by a slim profile of 6, 8 or 10mm and custom made to client requirements by Applelec.

Production uses a patented 3D V-cutting technology. This etches a uniform matrix onto the clear PMMA acrylic. This is then cut to a specified shape and size. Thermally managed LEDs in a range of colour temperatures or with RGB colour-changing properties are then securely embedded into the sheet using a patented technique. This ensures that the unit is robustly constructed and in particular stays cool to the touch.

The etched matrix pattern is a guide which ‘transports’ light from the LEDs across the surface of the panel, delivering homogenous illumination. The panels are manufactured in the UK and tailored to suit either internal or external installations, with IP45 rated panels available standard, or panels with IP67 rating on request.

The cool operating temperature of the sheet means that this material can provide a lighting solution for heat sensitive products and areas. Narrow panels can be made to fit slim shelving or counter display units. The panel has been used for luxury brands, such as Jimmy Choo and Mulberry. Smalll units can be combined to create large, tiled panels. The sheet can be cut into customised sizes and shapes with maximum panel size of 3000mm x 1500mm.

These blocks are suitable for use in load-bearing and non-bearing walls, accumulating walls and heat finnovens.

Additionally, the earth-based material properties of these bricks give them the ability to regulate interior building climates. A mud building, for example, acts like a third skin to the user and has a warm, relaxing atmosphere. Loam likewise naturally regulates interior environments. Because these clay bricks are not fired, their unique moisturizing and heat-accumulating properties are maintained. Due to the high mass of limestone, a mud wall can retain and give off heat well so that temperature fluctuations are effectively minimized. Furthermore, clay emits no harmful gases and substances to the indoor environment and also has a neutralizing effect on pollutants and cigarette smoke, for example.

The paper itself is made according to European and Asian craftsmanship traditions, made from flax (linnen) or kozo fibres (raffia of an Asian mulberry tree). From these fibres, paper pulp is made, which is put in a mould on top of a sieve. The optical fibres are integrated during the process of paper production, so that they are enclosed by the paper and thus held in the finished surface. The paper is then dried on the sieve, creating a smooth surface.

The optical fibers are fed by the high-light LEDs, which are integrated in compact light projectors with silent cooling technology. They range from small 3-Watt devices for subtle lighting effects, to LED projectors (comparable in light intensity and light colour with a 100W halogen flood lamp), to colour projectors that allow light shows. The projectors are compatible with a variety of lighting and media control systems, such as DMX, DALI or AMX. By a touch on the touchpad brightness and colour may be adjusted or lighting scenarios can be programmed.

The paper does not yellow since no wood materials are used with a high lignin content. Minimal changes of whiteness over the years, however, are due to the naturalness of the material and do not represent any loss of quality.

The material can be used as light emitting wallpaper, or to create objects such as lamps and artworks. Paper can be made moisture repellent on request, which can withstand the use of a damp cloth for light stains and minor impurities.

Finally, they lend themselves to process technology similar to that possessed by plastics.

The technology of Liquidmetal alloys provides for the optimization of properties for specific applications by tailoring the combination of process, chemistry and atomic structure. The technology of Liquidmetal alloys is proprietary and covered by numerous existing or pending patents.

The atomic structure is the most striking characteristic of the Liquidmetal alloys as it fundamentally differentiates Liquidmetal alloys from ordinary metals. The atomic structure of ordinary or conventional metals and alloys is periodic, where the layout of atomic elements shows repeating patterns over an extended range. This atomic structure is called “crystalline” and limits the overall performance of conventional metals. Liquidmetal alloys possess an “amorphous” atomic structure, which is truly unique. By contrast to the crystalline structure, no discernable patterns exist in the atomic structure of the unique Liquidmetal alloys. As such, properties superior to the limits of conventional metals can be achieved. This amorphous atomic structure leads to a unique set of characteristic properties for the family of Liquidmetal alloys. These characteristic properties are: High Yield Strength High Hardness Superior Strength/Weight Ratio Superior Elastic Limit High Corrosion Resistance High Wear-Resistance Unique Acoustical Properties One of the direct results of the unique atomic structure of Liquidmetal alloys is very high yield strength, which approaches the theoretical limit and far exceeds the strength currently available in crystalline metals and alloys. For example, yield strength of over 250 ksi has been achieved in Zr-base and Ti-base Liquidmetal alloys (VIT-001 series). This is more than twice the strength of conventional titanium alloys.

As the threat of depleting oil resources approaches, future petroleum-based plastics production will dramatically decrease. As a result, the discarded waste from the present era might be seen as a rare and natural resource that could be mined from deep underground.

The name Lithoplast suggests its abilities: Lithos, meaning “stone”, and Plast, meaning “capable of being shaped or moulded”. Lithoplast is made through a process inspired by Metamorphism (the same geological process that transforms limestone into marble) and after heating can be shaped in a similar way to clay. It is a speculative driven material that questions the notions of what is man-made and what is natural, what is bad and what is good, while illustrating shifts in material values and resources.

Lithoplast is a material illustration inspired by what researchers assume will happen to plastic pollution within the geological strata of the earth. By materialising the shifting boundaries between the synthetic and the natural, between the current value and speculative value of plastics, one can grasp a more unusual and honest amoral perspective on pollution. Lithoplast creates a functional union of wastes from multiple industries, and suggests a new, pliable material future.

Blending luminescence with ‘mistyness’ is exactly what this polymer does, changing in the appearance of Lumisty changes from transparent to translucent depending on the angle from which it is viewed.

It is made from mylar, an extraordinarily strong polyester film. Mylar is a brand name for BoPET, or biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate. Put simply, this is a high-strength version of the common PET polymer. The Lumisty material’s unique effect is the result of its microstructure. It was originally invented for ATM screens as a security concept, but the material is now finding more applications in the field of architecture.

The Lumisty appears clear or frosted depending on your viewing angle and comes in 3 types. One is clear when viewed straight-on, frosted when viewed from one side. The second is clear when viewed straight-on, frosted when viewed from either side. The last is the opposite of this: it is frosted when viewed straight-on but clear when viewed from either side.

Applications include interior glass, acrylic and polycarbonate surfaces. These could be retail or exhibition displays, active graphics, privacy and security screening and view control on glazed balustrades and walkways.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/lupine-fibreboard/,Lupine fibreboard,Other naturals,ONA1105,Iceland,Efnasmiðjan ehf,"Lupine fibreboards are produced from Alaska Lupine ( Lupinus nootkatensis ). Although almost the entire plant can be utilised for fibreboard production, the samples in this project were made from the aerial growth of the plant. Many plants possess defence mechanisms that deter their use as food sources. The primary defence mechanism of lupine is its high content of bitter compounds, rendering it unsuitable as animal feed. Consequently, in Iceland, its primary use has been for soil stabilisation. The fibreboards are 100% biodegradable without requiring controlled conditions, such as heat, for decomposition.

Several decomposition methods were explored during this project, each yielding slightly different results. A specific method allows the removal of the bitter compounds, enabling the fibre to be used in a variety of applications. The strength and properties of the fibreboards were tested and compared with other known materials. Standard test results indicate that lupine fibreboards exhibit characteristics similar to low-density fibreboard (insulation board) and medium-density fibreboard (MDF). These results suggest that the fibreboard is a promising material. However, the boards are sensitive to water and would require protective treatment to withstand moisture. Tests conducted on their use as food packaging have shown encouraging results.

Iceland is characterised by vast highlands and extensive sand-blown areas where few plants can thrive due to harsh weather conditions and shifting soil. The lupine plant is a legume, which enables it to produce nitrogen, providing nourishment both for itself and other plants, making it a sustainable option. Introduced to Iceland around 1945 to aid in the reclamation of sterile soil, the plant has played a crucial role in soil stabilisation, particularly along the sandy territories of Iceland’s south coast. However, due to its rapid spread, sowing lupine has been prohibited for several decades in Iceland, as it overgrows sensitive ecosystems such as moss and peatlands. Nonetheless, during midsummer, vast fields of lupine bloom across parts of the country, displaying striking blue flowers. Inspired by the abundant biomass of this remarkable plant, this project sought to explore potential uses for its fibres, leading to the development of lupine fibreboards.","Biobased, Biodegradable, Other naturals, fibreboard, sheet material",Matte,0%,Closed,Variable,Hard,Medium,Moderate,None,Unknown,Unknown,Poor,Moderate,Light,Moderate,Yes

This can be achieved with a production cycle based on a Circular Economy model and upcycling is a big step forward in this direction.

Upcycling is a neologism that keeps together two concepts that not always go hand-in-hand: first, the idea of recycling; and, second, the idea of improvement and quality (even though you are using discarded materials), thus the prefix “up”. In a Circular Economy the aim is to create less waste by making the most out of every possible material and fabric involved in the production process. In Imbotex’s case, recovered scraps of cashmere fabrics are Upcyled from the production of coats (and not only) in order to create a warm insulation. This pad is capable of maintaining the same properties of virgin materials, without requiring additional consumption. Imbotex’s particular form of insulation is named LUXEPAD – Cachemire Blend Edition.

LUXEPAD – Cachemire Blend Edition is created in three steps; firstly, recovered materials are gathered and sorted in Northern Italy; secondly, they are transformed through a mechanic process into very fine fibres; lastly, the fibres are blended with recycled polyester, creating a high performing insulating mix, ready to be processed to create the pad. This process, whose patent was filed, allowed Imbotex to create a product highly resilient, features extraordinary tensile and strength qualities and with consistent insulating capacity.

Made through a process that is less impactful in terms of energy consumption, waste production, water usage, CO2 emissions, LUXEPAD – Cachemire Blend Edition is a new frontier for ecologically-responsible fashion, giving new purpose to otherwise discarded precious materials.

This project is carried forward under the aegis of the Global Recycling Standard, a certification promoted by Textile Exchange, an established non-profit institution, that for over 15 years has been supporting responsible and sustainable product development in the textile industry.

Developed for the construction, architecture, and design sectors, it combines functional performance with a high degree of creative flexibility. Manufactured in Germany under strict quality standards, it is offered as raw panels—up to 2800 × 1250 mm in size (or up to 3500 × 1500 mm on request) with a standard thickness of 20 mm (15–40 mm available on request)—or as custom-cut pieces for diverse applications, including interiors and façades.

The material is produced from industrial glass waste generated during the manufacture of flat, solar, coloured, or bottle glass. Approximately 5% of glass production results in rejects, production faults, or excess volumes. These are collected, broken into shards, and processed through a controlled sintering method without binders or pressure, using only heat and time. The resulting sheets are cooled in a regulated process, then calibrated, optionally polished, and cut to size. Each panel is unique, with distinctive details and translucent qualities that are enhanced when backlit.

Sustainability is central to MAGNA Glaskeramik’s production. A significant portion of the required energy is supplied by the company’s own solar power system, and water used in manufacturing is recycled and reused multiple times. The product is certified with an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) and Cradle to Cradle credentials, contributing to credits in LEED and DGNB certified buildings. These attributes make it a valuable choice for sustainable construction projects.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/magoxid-coat/,Magoxid-coat,Coatings,COA115,Taiwan,"Techplasma Technology Co.,Ltd","MAGOXID-COAT® is a plasma chemical coating that improves magnesium alloys. The MAGOXID-COAT® layer is a crystalline oxide ceramic with a high content of extremely resistant compounds such as spinels, e.g. MgAl204. The plasma-chemical process produces oxide ceramic layers, which, in addition to providing a high level of protection against wear and corrosion, also meets other requirements such as hardness, uniform layer formation, fatigue strength, dimensional accuracy and temperature load capacity. The MAGOXID-COAT® plasma chemical process is suitable for the coating of almost any magnesium alloy as well as for the treatment of alloys containing noble earths and zirconium. With a density of just 1.74 g/cm3, magnesium is the lightest of the metals used for construction. MAGOXID-COAT® can improve the surface properties of almost any magnesium alloy. This coating makes it possible to use coated magnesium products in different sectors, for example: rollers, clutch components, sealing units or conveyor guide rails. Possible industries include: Automotive Valves and fittings Office and data technology Food processing Energy technology Household appliances Aerospace Telecommunications Coating takes place in a saline electrolyte solution. The component is connected in series to an external source of electricity and acts as an anode. During anodization oxygen plasma discharges itself on the component surface and briefly melts the surface thus forming 2 oxide ceramic layers that bond tightly with the outer metallic layer. A barrier layer with a thickness of about 100 nm constitutes the direct bond with the magnesium component. Following the barrier layer comes an oxide ceramic layer with low porosity density followed by one with high porosity density. This layer bond protects the magnesium against wear and corrosion and, thanks to its surface structure, it allows the absorption of lubricants as well as following treatments such as paintwork or impregnation. One variant of the MAGOXID-COAT® process is MAGOXID-COAT® black. This layer contains fade-resistant, chemically inert spinels of magnesium-aluminum oxide minerals and it is well suited for the treatment of virtually any magnesium-based material. For instance, MAGOXID-COAT® black is used for the inner coating of optical components or precision screw threads. It is ideal for heating radiators, for use in vacuum technology, microelectronics and in the aerospace industry.",Coatings,Matte,0%,Open,Medium,Hard,Medium,Poor,None,Good,Good,Good,Moderate,Light,Poor,No

https://materialdistrict.com/material/marquetry/,Marquetry,Wood,WOO328,Netherlands,Finemarq,"Marquetry patterns are composed of different materials, usually natural products such as wood veneer, straw, leather, mother-of-pearl and semi-precious stones, but also precious and nonprecious metals and glass. An endless palette of colours and textures is available, and everything that nature or technology have to offer can be incorporated into the final product.

Marquetry, also known as intarsia, can be applied in many variations, and is individual and timeless. From modern to traditional, geometric to Art Deco, arabesque or abstract, neoclassical to antique – marquetry runs the gamut of virtually all styles. Today, marquetry is a combination of cutting-edge technology, patience and unsurpassed craftsmanship. The basic elements are defined with computer techniques, and then processed with great precision using a laser cutter. Intermediate treatment with traditional techniques is sometimes required. Shading in hot sand is an example of this, as is applying accent lines.

Every segment, no matter how small, must be inserted into the basic pattern in the exact right place and manner. Pieces are removed from the basic element and replaced with contrasting or complementary parts. Structure, direction of grain and colour nuances are the most important variables in this context. Once a marquetry element is complete, it is applied to the background surface. This surface can be anything from furniture or wall and ceiling elements to figures on floors and doors or even loose decorative elements. Using different pressing techniques, the images are applied to the surface and, when required, can be finished with varnish and sanding treatments until the desired end result is achieved.","Biobased, Wood",Satin,0%,Closed,Smooth,Hard,Warm,Moderate,None,Poor,Moderate,Poor,Good,Medium,Moderate,Yes

This characteristic makes it completely water and gas tight, elastic, suitable as sealer and anti-fungal. Cell rubber is used as sealing material, in vibration isolation, acoustic insulation and temperature insulation. Cell rubber can be supplied in various qualities: NR (Natural Rubber): very elastic, cold-fast, good physical characteristics, not suitable for petrol, oil, grease and not ozone-fast. SBR (Styrene Butadiene Rubber): Water-resistant, resistant to bases and inorganic acids. NBR (Nitrile Butadiene Rubber): Resistant to oil, petrol, diesel and butane. CR (Chloroprene): chemical resistant, well resistant to ozone, weather and ageing; resistant to minerals, silicone oil, alcohol and glycols. EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Rubber): resistant to hot water and steam; acid-resistant; very well resistant against ozone, weather and ageing. (Mixtures of these materials are also available.) Cell rubber is produced on blocks and cut to the desired thicknesses, usually without a skin. Some qualities can be supplied with a skin on one or both sides. This does not influence the characteristics of the material. Cell rubber can be supplied in various ranges. These materials are usually supplied with a self-adhesive layer. Many shapes in nearly every size can be die cut or cut from plates. By being glued together, coiled material can also be delivered, although these materials can also be delivered with a self-adhesive layer.

Bonded Foam The raw materials for this foam quality are remainders of polyether and polyester foam. After grinding the foam into small pieces, it is bonded to a solid end product with a relatively high specific weight (from 60 to 320 kg/m3). This foam is used in the packaging industry, for acoustic insulation, as subfloor or as sport mat or filling.

Felt Felt can be processed in the same way as foam products, i.e. they can be made self-adhesive, die cut, cut, etc. Felt is used as an acoustic material, for capping, for insulation and to protect products.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/mbi-concrete-facing-bricks/,MBI Concrete facing bricks,Concretes,CON014,Netherlands,MBI De Steenmeesters,"MBI started in the Netherlands immediately after the Second World War with shortrun production of concrete building system components, but quickly realised that mass production would be more successful in the long run. It therefore switched over to the production of concrete bricks and blocks for paving and masonry. MBI has for decades been market leader in the Netherlands in the field of concrete masonry products.

MBI makes a distinction between stones for single-sided brick facing and bricks and blocks for double-sided brick facing. Single-sided brick facing is generally applied as an outer skin to cavity walls, but can also be used for interior walls. As a rule, double-sided brick facing is only applied to interior walls. The following choices are available for single-sided facing bricks:

Facing bricks with a finishing coat in geocolour, textured or smooth Facing bricks with a finishing coat are single-sided bricks which have been given a special finishing coat on a layer of concrete substrate. The application of this kind of finishing coat allows the combination of bricks with different kinds of textures and colours. Although these bricks look different, their mechanical and technical properties are identical. This means that various types of facing brick can be used in the same applications, so simplifying the choice of brick to be used.

Geocolour facing bricks Geocolour facing bricks are some of the most special and colourful products in MBI’s range. They derive their colour (and colour fastness) from the natural minerals incorporated in the finishing coat. ‘Washing’ the top layer with a high pressure spray creates a more or less fine-grained textured surface.

Cut facing bricks Cut facing bricks enjoy a special position in the collection. These bricks are produced in double the standard width and then cut in two after at least four weeks hardening. The cutting of the materials added gives the bricks a special appearance, sothat the masonry has a completely individual character. The use of natural materials such as Norwegian marble ensures that the bricks are colourfast. The following choices are available for double-sided facing bricks: – Interior wall bricks, textured or smooth – Plain double-sided interior wall bricks are available specially for double-sided facing work. The composition of the these bricks is homogeneous: each brick has two finished stretcher faces and two finished ends. – B2 blocks, textured, finely textured or smooth – Double-sided plain B2 blocks are available specially for double-sided facing work. The composition of these bricks is homogeneous: each brick has two finished stretcher faces and one finished end.

Advantages of MBI masonry products – The production process uses little energy and is environmentally friendly. – In principle the consistency of shape and size of all facing bricks, interior wall bricks and B2 blocks makes them suitable for processing with as little as 3 mm of pointing. – The production of accurately specified masonry joints presents no problem. – The texture and colour of the finishing coat on facing bricks can be varied, for example by the addition of colourfast natural stone, shells or glass. It is also possible to profile the finishing coat, in principle in any way desired. – The addition of special materials, such as marble or shells, to cut facing bricks, makes it possible to produce a brick with a special texture and colour. – Cut facing bricks can be supplied in twice the standard length. – It is possible to combine different modular sizes of facing brick. – All masonry products are user-friendly to handle.

MBI sees its future developments as depending in part on solutions developed in consultation with architects to specific requirements presented by them. MBI does not see product development and innovation as an inward-directed process but assomething to be achieved in cooperation with designers.",Concretes,Matte,0%,Open,Coarse,Hard,Cool,Poor,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Heavy,Moderate,No

It always has a unique appearance and is suitable for many different applications like facades, sun control, second skin. Thanks to the various fixing techniques, it is possible to attach MD Expanded Metal panels to any background. Whether it is about transformation or new construction, MD Expanded Metal is the product to achieve an excellent end result.

How it is made MD Expanded metal facade cladding is made by cutting a regular pattern of slits into a metal plate and reshaping it. It can be used to create a more transparent facade by making diamond-shaped or circular openings in the plate. MD Expanded metal is also an economical product since no material is wasted in its production.

Many patterns With MD Expanded Metal you can choose between 30 different patterns for your unique façade cladding. Then you can also decide which transparency you want to apply. Where you want to keep out the sun, the facade is less open than where you want to let the sun in. That is why MD Expanded Metal is also extremely suitable as a sun-resistant facade cladding. It is also possible to create you our variable mesh pattern.

Different materials You can apply MD Expanded in aluminum, corten, copper, stainless steel and magnelis. What you can choose best depends on the climate and environment of the project and the appearance of the facade that you want to pursue. In general, aluminum is chosen. This material is light and maintenance-friendly with a long lifespan. It is also 100% recyclable and recycling requires relatively little energy.

Surface treatments You can choose between powder coating or anodizing your MD Expanded Metal facade cladding of aluminum. All conceivable colors are possible with powder coats. You can choose for a standard coating that requires some maintenance or a durable coating that requires no maintenance. Anodizing makes aluminum even more beautiful, because anodizing builds up a layer in the aluminum and is not a layer on top of it like powder coating. The metal aspect is therefore better preserved. In terms of colors, you can choose from a certain color palette. The sublimation and printing of the MD Expanded Metal panels is also possible.

Fixing the façade Ultimately, a facade must also be installed. We have visible and invisible fastening systems. When choosing a fastening system, design, functionality and the available budget form the framework. When realizing the facade, Metadecor can also help with the realization of the insulation, the auxiliary construction, the facade lighting or acoustic parts.","Sense & Sensibility, Metals",Matte,0%,Closed,Coarse,Hard,Cool,Moderate,None,Moderate,Good,Good,Good,Medium,Moderate,No

An even spreading of the points results in an even illumination. The grid points are printed in ink with ceramic pigments at a high temperature, whereby the pigments become one with the glass. This ink is very scratch-resistant and resistant to high temperatures and chemical influences. The total surface of the printed grid is around 10-15% of the total surface of the glass, keeping the transparent qualities of the glass largely intact. The printed glass has a low iron percentage, because of the need to be able to display every possible colour evenly in the glass.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/merck-effect-pigments/,Merck Effect Pigments,Coatings,COA004,Germany,Merck,"Merck Effect Pigments are divided in four specific product ranges:

Iriodin is the trademark for the pearl lustre pigments. Based on the natural mineral mica, they are covered with a thin layer of metal oxides, for example titanium dioxide and/or iron oxide. Through interplay of transparency, refraction index, coating and multiple reflections, a variety of colour effects (silver-white, interference, gold and metallic lustre effects) is achieved. All Iriodin pigments can be used alone or in combination with other colours. Iriodin pigments meet the latest findings in product safety and environmental compatibility and are non-flammable, electrically non-conductive and are temperature stable up to 800°C. Furthermore, they’re free from polluting heavy metals, react neutrally upon disposal, since as mineral pigments they are insoluble in water (as well as in solvents) and do not decompose. They present no problems with disposal, are non-toxic and therefore suitable for food packaging and correspond to the European norm EN 71/Section 3 for toys. They also present no problems in plastic recycling.

Colorstream pigments are different from conventional pigments through their physical and geometrical attributes, which are based on synthetically manufactured SiO2 (Silicium dioxide) platelets that are coated with metal oxides. The very thin, smooth pigment particles create unusual, iridescent interference effects. The colour transformation can even be seen well in subdued lighting conditions. The special feature of these pigments is the soft, flowing transition from one colour to another. Owing to the soft, flowing colour transitions, Colorstream multicolour effect pigments are best suited for applications in automobile manufacturing, printing inks, plastics, varnishes etc.

Xirallic effect pigments are based on aluminium oxide ( Al2O3 ) platelets coated with metal oxides. The Al2O3 platelets are produced synthetically using a new crystallisation process. The fine grain size (5 – 30 μm) and a narrow particle size distribution guarantee the problem-free implementation in application. This new type of substrate for the Xirallic pigments enables a very strong glitter effect. Lighter body colour, greater colour intensity and a more powerful lustre are the advantages of these pigments.

Minatec’s special feature is its substrate layer structure in which mica, an inactive substrate core, is coated with a dense layer of a conductive inorganic mix of metal oxides (tin oxide mixed with antimony varnish).Pure tin oxide is actually an insulator, which after doping with antimony becomes a semi-conductor. With its platelet-shaped design, the mica core provides a way to optimally support the outer shell in its function. The flat design of the pigment is especially suited for conductive ways, since there emerges a method of pigments within the top layer of the varnish.","Sense & Sensibility, Coatings",Glossy,0%,Open,Smooth,Hard,Medium,Poor,None,Unknown,Good,Good,Good,Light,Moderate,No
https://materialdistrict.com/material/merdacotta/,Merdacotta,Ceramics,CER230,Italy,Museo della Merda,"These ceramics, called Merdacotta, are made from cow dung and clay. Merdacotta consists for the most part of dried cow dung, mixed with Tuscan clay, straw and farm waste, in variable quantities. The methane and urea, which is what makes poo smell, are extracted, making the dung odourless.

The result is a material similar to terracotta, but Merdacotta is lighter and more resilient to cold. The museum produces tiles, vases, flowerpots, benches, mugs and dishes. The tableware is covered with a non-lead transparent glaze and baked. When the pieces are baked at 1,000 degrees Celsius (1,832 degrees Farhenheit), the straw burns up, giving the products gaps and imperfections, like the terracotta before it became industrialised.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/meta-coat/,META-COAT,Coatings,COA117,Germany,AHC Oberflächentechnik GmbH,"META-COAT is a Nickel-Phosphorous layer on plastic base components in order to improve temperature resistance, wear resistance, chemical resistance and solderability. Because of the application process of the metal coating, the composition can be varied. The final properties also depend on the original base material.

META-COAT layers are produced on plastics by means of a pre-treatment, tailored to the base material and geometry of the component. The pre-treatment is largely based on a mechanical micro-structuring, a chemical or physical alteration of the surface or combinations of these pre-treatments. After activation of the surface, metals like copper, nickel, silver, tin or gold are deposited by a chemical (electroless) or electrolytic process. With electrolytic processes, certain restrictions regarding complex shaped parts (undercuts, blind holes, grooves) have to be considered.

The temperature resistance depends on the type of selected base material and the coating. For example, a coating system consisting of 5 μm copper and 3 μm tin on PEEK or PPS can withstand a short-term temperature load of up to 330 °C as e.g. during a soldering process.

With the META-COAT process the wear resistance of plastics can be considerably improved. The layer can, for example, protect polyamide against chemicals like chloroform, methylene chloride, formic acid, phenols and cresol. Solderability is improved by adding a silver layer.","Coatings, nickel",Matte,0%,Open,Coarse,Hard,Medium,Poor,None,Unknown,Moderate,Moderate,Good,Light,Good,No

https://materialdistrict.com/material/micro-perforated-veneer/,Micro Perforated Veneer,Wood,WOO296,Netherlands,Lambri International BV,"A whole new perception of veneer can be created with the use of micro perforations. Micro perforated veneer has perforations of only Ø1,5 mm and 5 mm centre-to-centre (ctc), thus enabling the structure of the veneer to remain completely visible, while at the same time providing effective sound absorption.

Acoustic perforations of Ø5, Ø7, Ø8 or Ø9 mm and with a ctc distance of 16, 32 or 64 mm are suitable for creating mosaic patterns and these various patterns can be used together to form a unique design.

Acoustic grooves of Ø8 mm with a ctc distance of 24, 32 or 48 mm inspire special combinations, while the panels can also be placed perpendicularly to one another, thereby creating a distinctive pattern.

In addition to circular perforations, micro perforated veneer with square perforations and a ctc distance of 32 mm is also possible.

In addition to enhanced acoustic properties, wood is used efficiently in the production of micro perforated veneer. Due to modern production methods, around 800-1000 m2 of veneer can be produced from 1 m3 of wood. Veneer sheets with a width of 10-25 cm are book-matched and glued to form panels.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/micro-perforation-panels/,Micro-Perforation panels,Wood,WOO447,Netherlands,Acoustic Trend B.V.,"Micro-Perforation panels for walls or ceilings combine the natural beauty of wood with exceptional acoustic performance, as the sound is absorbed by the surface of micro-perforated wood veneer. Acoustic panels without changing the aesthetics of your milling work.

The almost invisible perforations go unnoticed at normal viewing distances and provide a solid appearance. These high-quality micro-perforated panels can be manufactured flat or curved and installed using various industrial suspension methods. Panels are available in standard or custom sizes.

Micro-Perforation can be integrated into many existing Acoustic Trend product types, such as veneer panels, planks, continuous planks, tongue & groove, wooden baffles and more. Modern architecture and design increasingly use materials such as glass, steel and stone that meet the requirements of more open offices and meeting facilities. These hard surfaces reflect sound and contribute to an increase in sound level and a decrease in productive environments.

Micro-Perforation panels from Acoustic Trend counteract the noise and the unpleasant effects on people and employees. By means of micro-perforation, the sound energy / sound enters through the micro-perforated surface and on the underlying perforated core. Here it is effectively absorbed and transported.

An inner layer and outer layer of acoustic fleece further improves the absorption and reduction of sound vibrations. Ideal for acoustically effective office furniture, partitions, wall and ceiling applications.

Designed for integration into building envelopes and glazing systems, the material offers passive control of solar radiation, daylight, heat, airflow, and visibility. Its open-area ratio and louvre orientation enable selective environmental filtering while maintaining transparency and structural durability.

The material provides effective solar shading by significantly reducing solar heat gain without obstructing daylight or outward visibility. Independent assessments report reductions in indoor heat build-up and associated cooling loads, contributing to improved thermal comfort and lower energy consumption in buildings.

Due to its finely spaced metal louvres, MicroLouvre™ also acts as a glare reduction and light diffusion medium. It regulates the transmission and dispersion of natural and artificial light, which is applicable in façade systems, external lighting fixtures, and interior environments requiring controlled illumination.

In fire-prone environments, the mesh functions as a physical barrier against airborne embers and radiant heat. When installed as part of external screens or ventilated façades, it may contribute to the mitigation of fire spread and internal heat transfer during wildfire exposure.

The material is compatible with various façade configurations, including curtain walls, ventilated cladding systems, and retrofit shading devices. It is also applicable in restoration contexts, where it provides performance upgrades without compromising the architectural character of the building. Wind tunnel and durability testing indicate suitability for installation in high-exposure conditions, including hurricane-prone regions.

MicroLouvre™ also provides directional visibility control. The orientation and spacing of the louvres allow for unobstructed outward vision while limiting inward lines of sight, offering passive privacy without reducing natural light transmission.

Further applications include its use in interior architecture, branding, and display systems. The mesh can be coated or anodised in a range of finishes to accommodate design requirements while retaining its structural integrity and functional properties.

The material is manufactured from metal alloys with long service life and recyclability, contributing to circular design strategies. Its integration supports energy-efficient building performance, reduced reliance on mechanical systems, and compliance with sustainable design standards.","High-tech, Sense & Sensibility, Translucency, Metals",Matte,,Open,Coarse,Soft,Cool,Moderate,None,Good,Good,Good,Moderate,Light,Good,No

Mogu Acoustic modules are made from soft, foam-like mycelium materials and of upcycled textile residues. Thanks to the unique technology, Mogu Acoustic panels represent today the most sustainable solution dedicated to acoustic comfort. They are characterised by a unique velvety finishing and a 3D shape, to maximise sound absorption. Mogu Acoustic products are 100% circular products, with an extremely virtuous manufacturing cycle. They are designed to maximize the acoustic comfort in noisy spaces such as restaurants, offices and retails with high reverberation time.

COLOUR PALETTE The colourful finishing used for Mogu Acoustic palette fully covers the mycelium materials with only 50 g/sqm (dry weight), it is elastic (thus not acoustically blocking), and it offers a pleasant soft touch! The paint is a water-based, heavy-metal free bicomponent dispersion with low VOC, designed with a very low gloss to ensure a matte aesthetics and a soft touch experience.

ACOUSTIC DATA Mogu Acoustic panels feature excellent performances particularly in the medium frequencies (250-1000 hz). Their decorative design and functionality makes them a perfect solution to absorb most of speech noise in noisy environments, such as restaurant, lounges and small to large office spaces.

FIRE RATING Mogu Acoustic panels are naturally fire retardant thanks to the ability of mycelium to slow down flame spread and form char. Even without treatment, Mogu Acoustic panels carbonize and burn very slowly. Thanks to an eco-friendly treatment, their fire reaction is further improved to class B-s2-d0, which allows their application in every public space. We carefully selected the finishing treatment choosing the most eco-friendly solution we could find. Mugu’s panels are treated with a water-based, zero halogens, heavy metal- and solvent-free paint.

VOC FREE As sustainability is Mogu’s core value, Mogu is committed to choose as harmless chemicals as possible. The decorative paint provides not only an outstanding aesthetics – it is also certified as safe, durable and neutrally contributing to indoor air quality. Mogu Acoustic materials have been tested for allergenic and VOC Emissions. As test results show, the products are safer than wood and many other industrial materials populating our everyday living environments.","Acoustic, Biobased, Other naturals, mycelium, wall panels",Matte,0%,Open,Variable,Resilient,Medium,Good,Moderate,Good,Good,Moderate,Good,,Moderate,Yes

A special combination of 70% Norwegian carded woolen yarn and 30% New Zealand combed yarn gives this upholstery fabric its delicate, simple appearance. Molly’s quality is not to be found in a colour palette or in uniform consistency but in the unobtrusive design of the fabric, the variations in the weave and the feeling of a genuine, natural product. Because Molly is undyed, there will be natural colour variations from one consignment to another. This is unavoidable in such a pure, natural product.

Due to its purity, simplicity and unobtrusiveness, Molly is particularly suitable for use in combination. The 16 different Molly designs combine beautifully with each other as well as with other textiles and materials that have much bolder colours and designs.

Molly is designed by Swedish textile designer Åsa Pärson, a graduate of Textilhögskolan, Borås and Konstfack, Stockholm. This is her first collection for Kvadrat.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/moso-bamboo-industriale/,MOSO Bamboo Industrial Flooring,Other naturals,ONA167,Netherlands,Moso International,"MOSO Bamboo Industrial Flooring is a robust, modern looking industrial floor made from short strips of the sustainable resource bamboo. MOSO Bamboo flooring combines the virtues of the best hardwoods (hardness, looks) with the immense growing capacity of the highly renewable giant bamboo species MOSO.

MOSO Bamboo Industrial Flooring consists of one layer of solid bamboo strips, which are bundled into a block using tape, creating the industrial look. After sanding off this tape, the floor is filled and finished, and directly glued onto the subfloor, creating a solid, very robust floor, ideal for large project applications. Being made of such small strips, the floor is very stable – making it the perfect solution for application on floor heating. This floor has the thickest wear layer of all MOSO floors: up to 15mm.

MOSO Bamboo Industrial Flooring is available in various sizes, colours (natural, caramel, chocolate) & styles (vertical, high Density) to provide a tailor made solution for everyone.

Key characteristics of MOSO Bamboo Industrial Flooring are that it is sustainable, ecological and highly renewable. The giant bamboo species MOSO grows to maturity within 5 years (compared to over 50 years for most hardwood species) and can therefore act as the green alternative for scarce tropical hardwood.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/moso-bamboo-n-durance-cladding/,MOSO® Bamboo N-durance® cladding,Other naturals,ONA1140,Netherlands,Moso International,"MOSO® Bamboo N-durance® is a cladding material made from massively compressed strips of Moso bamboo, designed specifically for exterior applications. Through a specialised Outdoor-Density® production process, the bamboo fibres are subjected to high pressure and heat, resulting in exceptional stability, durability, and hardness. The material undergoes a steam-pressure treatment that naturally caramelises the bamboo, producing a warm, rich caramel tone without the need for artificial staining. To enhance its appearance and weather resistance, the surface is finished with a Sikkens Cetol WF 771 Savanna coating, giving the material a lighter, refined amber colour that, over time, gracefully weathers to a natural grey.

Bamboo N-durance® achieves the highest durability class according to European standards and offers outstanding fire safety performance, reaching a B-s1-d0 classification under EN 13501-1 without the need for additional chemical fire retardants. The material’s density of approximately 1200 kg/m³, combined with a Brinell hardness rating of about 9.5 kg/mm², ensures that it is highly resistant to mechanical damage and suited for long-term outdoor use with minimal maintenance. The cladding boards are precision-profiled with smooth surfaces, tongue-and-groove joints at the ends, and bevelled edges, facilitating secure and visually seamless installations.

The underlying resource, Moso bamboo, matures within four to five years and regenerates from its existing root system after harvesting, enabling annual harvesting without contributing to deforestation. This rapid renewability, combined with the material’s capacity to store carbon, positions MOSO® Bamboo N-durance® as a sustainable and environmentally responsible alternative to tropical hardwoods and non-renewable materials.

Sustainability :

The giant bamboo species Moso belongs to the fastest growing plants in the world. It reaches its final length of up to 20 meters within a couple of months (with a speed of up to 1 meter a day during the growing season!). It takes the stem around 4-5 years to mature and acquire its excellent hardwood like characteristics (hardness, strength, dimensional stability). One bamboo plant consists of several poles and new shoots will grow from the mother plant every year. Generally 20-25% of the poles in a sustainable bamboo forest or plantation can be harvested each year. This happens without decreasing the number of poles per hectare! The plant does not die after harvesting (as with trees), so no deforestation. On the contrary, by harvesting the mature plants, the yield and quality of the plantation actually increases.","Biobased, Other naturals, bamboo",Matte,0%,Closed,Smooth,Resilient,Medium,Moderate,Moderate,Moderate,Moderate,Moderate,Moderate,Medium,Moderate,Yes

https://materialdistrict.com/material/moss-concrete/,Moss concrete,Concretes,CON197,Netherlands,Respyre,"Respyre’s moss concrete is a revolutionary material, designed to foster urban greening and sustainability. This concrete solution emphasises environmental friendliness, biodiversity, and urban aesthetic enhancement.

Composition and Properties The composition of Respyre’s moss concrete includes recycled concrete aggregates and other residual streams, making it an eco-friendly choice. Key characteristics such as porosity, water retention, a micropore texture, and the inclusion of specific nutrients and acidity levels are integral to its design. These features collectively create an ideal setting for moss to grow and thrive on the concrete’s surface.

Bio-receptive Qualities Respyre’s concrete is labeled “bioreceptive,” indicating its ability to support biodiversity, particularly moss. The concrete’s surface, post-hardening, is conducive to moss growth. This compatibility with moss is a significant aspect of Respyre’s design, promoting a harmonious relationship between the built environment and natural elements.

Moss Compatibility and Environmental Impact The choice of moss is strategic due to its rhizoids, which are nondestructive and function as adhesives. Unlike roots, rhizoids do not damage the substrate they grow on, making moss an ideal plant for growing on concrete surfaces. Moreover, moss has several environmental benefits. It is excellent at retaining moisture and absorbing significant quantities of fine particulates, thus improving air quality. The presence of moss also encourages biodiversity by providing a habitat for small insects.

Applications and Maintenance Respyre’s moss concrete is versatile, suitable for new constructions and as a plaster for existing structures. It facilitates the spontaneous growth of moss in appropriate environments and is low-maintenance. The concrete does not require complex anchoring systems, extensive upkeep, or frequent pruning, distinguishing it from other green facade options like living walls. The nutrients added to the concrete ensure rapid growth of moss, and its porous nature allows it to cool structures through evapotranspiration, offering thermal benefits.

Economic and Aesthetic Aspects Respyre’s moss concrete is an economically viable solution for urban greening projects. It is less expensive than other green facade solutions and can be scaled up effectively, making it a cost-efficient option. The aesthetic appeal of moss-covered facades also contributes to urban beautification, transforming grey concrete jungles into lush, green landscapes.

The possibilities are infinite.

Using glazed ceramics in construction has major advantages: it is extremely strong, durable and gives buildings a tactile and unique appearance. Studio Christine Jetten (SCJ) is a pioneer in the custom design of glazed ceramics. Over the past twenty-five years, SCJ has collaborated with architects to construct the defining elements of modern international architecture, of which a few examples are shown here, focusing on the effect of multiple layers in glaze application.

Together with progressive architects, Jetten has formed a vanguard that has freed glazed ceramics from its primarily decorative purpose, as it now has the name and fame it deserves: it is a building material in its own right. Thanks to the space Jetten took and was given in the design process by the architects she worked with, the unique quality of glazed ceramics was able to reach its full potential.

This experience taught her that ceramics, as malleable as they are strong, lend themselves by definition to made-to-measure projects. As does the layer of glazing which offers infinite possibilities for light reflection, absorption, textures and layering in the façades of buildings. Glazed ceramic facades are sustainable, strong and the glazed surface provides depth to buildings, as well as artistic quality.

The rise of ceramics in buildings fits in seamlessly with the need for more tactility and recognizability in cities, but also with climate choices and sustainable materials.","Sense & Sensibility, Ceramics, tiles",Variable,0%,Closed,Variable,Hard,Cool,Poor,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Medium,Good,No

The material comes from extracts from the top of a mushroom (its button). It is processed in a manner similar to that of animal leathers. However, the tanning procedure is completely natural. This means it takes place without using toxic chemicals.

This chemically soft process generates a material which the manufacturer states is ideal for next-to-skin use. Laboratory tests show that this kind of mushroom ‘skin’ is a hygienic material: it stops the proliferation of bacteria.

It also has a strong absorbent capacity. Moisture is taken into the material and slowly released. These two factors are of use in a number of applications, such as shoe insoles, watch straps and so on. Muskin is also breathable.

As the material is grown, Muskin sizes can vary. Standard sizes are approximately 40 cm x 15-20 cm.

Biohm harnesses the power of mycelium – the vegetative filament root structure of mushrooms – to produce materials by growing it through organic and synthetic substrates such as the by-products and waste from other industries.

Thermal performance Initial testing indicates that mycelium insulation has good thermal conductivity with an indicative range of 0.03 – 0.06 W/m.K.

Fire performance Mycelium does not only performs as well as traditional construction materials in thermal and acoustic insulation but, as a natural material, it is also safer and healthier. Mycelium does not contain the synthetic, resin-based materials that can cause harmful toxic smoke and the quick spread of flames during a fire.

Sustainability In keeping with their circular principles, Biohm identifies commercial and agricultural by-products that would otherwise go to landfill and utilises them as both a valuable input for their manufacturing process and as a second revenue stream through ‘waste’ management contracts. The entire manufacturing process only has a positive impact on the environment, meaning it is completely regenerative. Biohm’s manufacturing process is estimated to be carbon-negative, sequestering at least 16 tonnes of carbon per month.

Durability Biohm believes that materials should be made to last as long as their intended use and that sustainable and circular end-of-life considerations should be embedded into the product itself. Independent insitu testing of mycelium has demonstrated that they are at least as durable as conventional materials and retain their performance over their life. The material can then be fed back into the manufacturing process or otherwise cold composted.

Health & Well-being As we spend around 90% of our time within buildings, creating a healthy environment is critical to our physical well-being. Biohm’s insulation is breathable, wicks moisture and contains negligible amounts of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), achieving an A+ rating when tested by BRE in accordance with BS EN ISO 16000-10:2006. It allows air to pass through it naturally whilst also blocking particulates, reducing damp and improving indoor air quality.

Buildability Biohm’s mycelium is manufactured in accordance with usual industry standard dimensions (1200×2400) and can be easily installed in projects without need for further training or additional safety equipment. Custom dimensions can also be achieved to meet the needs of the project. Zoe Laughlin, Founder of the Institute of Making and Professor at UCL, setting fire to our mycelium at over 1000oC whilst an ice cream bar sits on the other side of the fire icecold, completely intact and still crispy. The mycelium almost forms a complete heat and fire barrier and self-extinguishes once the flame is removed! Biohm was featured in the BBC4 Documentary ‘The Secret Story of Stuff: Materials of a Modern Age’.

Acoustic performance Mycelium provides excellent acoustic insulation and tests show an acoustic absorption of at least 75% at 1000Hz (the typical frequency of road traffic noise), opening the market for mycelium as an architectural acoustic panel. By comparison, mineral wool is only able to achieve 40% absorption.","Biobased, Biodegradable, Other naturals, mycelium",Variable,0%,Closed,Variable,Resilient,Warm,Good,Moderate,Moderate,Good,Moderate,Moderate,Light,Moderate,Yes

Using Mylar bags with oxygen absorbers removes up to 99.99% of oxygen. The best vacuum sealer machines only remove around 99.5% oxygen, making oxygen absorbers 50 times more effective. Mylar bags with oxygen absorbers will remove the oxygen, but not nitrogen or other gases, so the actually volume of gas in the bag will only reduce by approximately one fifth. Bacteria can only grow in aerobic (oxygen rich) environments, so the presence of nitrogen and other gases in the sealed bag will not allow bacteria to grow.

Mylar bags are also much ‘tougher’ and more resistant to gas permeability than vacuum sealer bags, due to their metalised nature. Mylar bags can be considered to be like a flexible aluminium can, protecting the contents from not just gas permeability, but also light, heat, pests and damage due to impact and environmental factors.

ECOS silver nanowires are engineered to have a high electrical conductivity with a low concentration or content of pure silver. The long, thin wire shape, in contrast to spherical nanoparticles, allows the particles to be in contact with each other from further distances.

The nanowires currently exist as transparent conducting coatings and films and are being developed to use in OLED lighting, smart polymers and fibers, IR shielding, transparent elecrodes for PV, and touch sensors for displays and screens.

AgPURE silver nanoparticles have antimicrobial properties and are used as an additive for hygienic surfaces. Silver has been known to be antimicrobial for many decades, but the nanoparticles are designed to have maximum antimicrobial effect and are able to be combined with many types of products. The nanosilver continuously releases silver ions without decreasing the antimicrobial activity over time. AgPure is stable at temperatures over 300 C which allows it to be used in microfiber production.

AgPURE has been used in many products such as UVEX protective clothing, integrated with microfibers and filament yarns, coatings, or is available as a solution.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/nanogel-translucent-aerogel-2/,Translucent aerogel,Glass,GLA046,Germany,Cabot Corporation,"Cabot aerogel is a family of highly porous, hydrophobic, high surface area amorphous silica particles or granules. Aerogel is a hydrophobic amorphous silica product that is chemically similar to common fumed silica products. The most significant differences are that aerogel has larger aggregate sizes, higher surface areas and larger pore volumes, and is produced in a sol gel manufacturing process.

The highly porous structure of aerogel allows light to diffuse throughout a daylighting system.

Translucent aerogel granules have a particle size distribution of 1 to 3 millimeters. Aerogel is a highly porous open structure with an average pore size of ~20 nanometers. This pore size is smaller than the mean free path of air which greatly restricts gas conduction and convection inside the particles. It is this feature that makes aerogel a poor conductor of thermal energy, and is therefore a great thermal insulator.

The material is mainly used for cosmetics, industrial isolation, building isolation, and daylighting applications.","Healing Environment, Glass, insulation",Matte,50-100%,Open,Medium,Resilient,Warm,Good,Moderate,Good,Good,Good,Good,Light,Good,No

Their products are mainly used in the mattress, horticultural, automotive and filter industry. There are however many more possibilities for these fibres in packaging, insulation and in the shoe-industry.

Below is a summary of natural fibres Enkev provide:

Bamboo fibres have many applications including home textiles, bedding, underwear, sportswear, etc. Bamboo fibre finished products have become popular in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, North American and European markets.

Made from the Bombyx mori silkworm, silk fibres have been used as a luxury fibre for centuries. These fibres feature a prism-like cross section with rounded edges, giving a light refracting sheen to the fibre.

Coconut fibre is very tough yet also elastic, barely deteriorating at all over time. Coir (coconut fibre) is a product that is naturally adapted to the human body. The fibre is collected from the coconut husk, a resource that is widely available.

Flax fibres are amongst the oldest fibre crops in the world. Flax fibre is extracted from the base or skin of the stem of the flax plant. Flax fibre is soft, lustrous and flexible. Flax, also known as common flax or linseed (Linum usitatissimum) is a member of the genus Linum in the family Linaceae.

The history of cotton production can be traced back over 7,000 years. Cotton is possibly nature’s purest form of cellulose. Like many natural fibres, cotton is soft, breathable and very comfortable against human skin. It is a fine fibre, which is also strong and durable, with excellent absorbency characteristics.

Hemp fibres are long, strong and durable. Hemp fibres conduct heat, can be easily dyed, resist mildew, block ultraviolet light and are naturally anti-bacterial. Hemp has been used for centuries to make rope, canvas and paper. Long hemp fibres can be spun and woven to make crisp, linen-like fabric for clothing, home furnishing textiles and floor coverings.

Abaca is extracted from the leaf sheath around the trunk of the abaca plant, a close relative of the banana plant, which is native to the Philippines grows widely throughout the humid tropics. Harvesting abaca is laborious. Each stalk must be cut into strips, which are scraped to remove the pulp.

These wool materials are ideal for use in insulation, in mattresses or upholstery, as well as for use in luxury garments and knitwear.

Dutch Texel wool is harvested from a sustainable source without detriment or harm to the animal. Each sheep is shorn every spring, resulting in about 11lbs of high quality wool. The sheep are raised organically on land that has never been used for agriculture and has therefore been protected from chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides.

Alpaca is a type of animal fibre offering excellent comfort, feel and performance. Its unique properties make it an ideal material for use in high quality sleep solutions.

Cashmere is a type of luxury wool. Its silken feel, feather-light weight, and appreciable status make it highly desirable. Cashmere is derived from the wool or fur of the Kashmir goat. Kashmir goats are primarily raised in Mongolia, but many are also bred in Iran, Tibet, India and China.

Merino wool has excellent shine, legendary softness, great breathability, and considerable warmth considering its minimal weight. Merino sheep are most often raised in the mountainous regions of Australia and New Zealand. Merino is praised for its easily dyeable pure white colour.

Specially suitable for installing walkable and trafficable paving on foundation layers of pouring material and draining concrete on an inverted roof. The drainage system prevents the build-up of hydrostatic pressure against the waterproofing membrane.

The special monofilament fabric combines high puncture resistance and minimal stretch, which can withstand the forces caused by static and dynamic loads from traffic. This also applies during installation because the filter fabric can also withstand the stresses of mechanical or dynamic compression of the foundation layer by means of a vibrating plate. This ensures that the filter geotextile is not punctured and the drainage layer remains free of additional filler material. The powerful drainage core with a compressive strength of approx. 1,200 kPa ensures that the drainage system retains its shape and therefore its original building height, even under dynamic loads. This drainage system is vapor permeable and therefore suitable for inverted roof constructions.

Tested You can request a test report from us about the functionality and stability of the system under dynamic loads. This practical research was carried out by the Technical University of Munich (DE).

Rock & roll The ND Drainage Systems are easy and quick to install because the filter, drainage and (sliding and) protection layer are glued together. The ND Drainage Systems are supplied as rolls, making them easy to handle and quick to unroll.

Glued, not thermally bonded The filter, protective (and slip) layers are glued and not thermally bonded to the core of the dimpled core. This prevents damage to the mechanical and hydraulic properties of the geotextiles and the entire drainage system. It also prevents that geotextiles form being pressed between the dimples, which could jeopardize good drainage. The overlap of the filter geotextile ensures optimal filtration.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/neptutherm/,NeptuTherm,Other naturals,ONA452,Germany,Neptu GmbH,"NeptuTherm is a 100% natural, high-performing insulation material that comes directly from the ocean. It is made from the fibres of ‘Neptune balls,’ also known as the seaweed plant Posidonia oceanic. Neptune balls are found in huge quantities along the shores of the Mediterranean, where they are considered a waste product and actively removed from beaches.

But this plentiful and naturally renewable material is far too valuable to end up in a landfill because its performance as an insulating material is exceptional: it is naturally fire resistant (B2), offers class 1 mould resistance, is great in terms of heat storage capacity and has a thermal conductivity of 0.037 W/(m•K).

As a further benefit, NeptuTherm contains no additives. The eco-INSTITUTE in Cologne has confirmed that Neptune balls are 100% organic and completely free of toxic matter. And this makes the material particularly interesting for those who suffer from allergies.

Applications: NeptuTherm is generally installed by a professional, but can be installed by the layman as well. It can be filled into roof, wall and ceiling cavities and then packed tight by hand. For difficult to reach locations, it can be installed with a blower machine. It is suitable therefore for installation in new build and renovation projects – historic renovation projects in particular.

A Biobased material: NeptuTherm offers an additional advantages over other biobased materials in terms of its origins. One particular difficulty surrounding biobased materials is that they sometimes stem from agricultural lands and are grown at the expense of global food production. Because NeptuTherm is derived from the ocean and is broadly considered a ‘waste material,’ it does not compete with arable land for its production.","Biobased, Ecology, Other naturals",Matte,0%,Open,Medium,Resilient,Warm,Good,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Light,Moderate,Yes

The yarn is turned in a mixed fabric containing 50% cotton, which has the same anti-bacterial, anti-mould, relaxing, deodorising properties of the cypress yarn. Specific tests, performed by a qualified external laboratory following the UNI EN ISO 20645, proved the antibacterial efficiency of a Cypress/Cotton fabric against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, with a reduction of the bacterial growth up to 60% and 85%, respectively.

The fabrics made with nettle fibres are a useful alternative to the use of other natural fibres such as hemp, linen and cotton, and will play an increasingly important role in the years to come. The nettle fibres have a special feature: thanks to their hollow structure, they are natural thermal insulators. The stinging nettle is a perennial plant that thrives in highly nitrogenous and fertilised soils, making it a viable solution that could create a new scene in Central Europe. Nettles are resistant to diseases and pests (being themselves a weed), so they do not need harmful chemical treatments and, growing undisturbed, can also host more than 40 species of insects, some of which (such as the Red Admiral and the larva of Small Turtle Shell) are entirely dependent on this plant for their survival.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/newspaperwood/,NewspaperWood,Wood,WOO222,Netherlands,Vij5,"NewspaperWood is a new material invented by Mieke Meijer, developed together with and licensed to the Dutch design label Vij5.

The underlying idea is simple. Every day, piles of newspapers are discarded and recycled into new paper. Mieke Meijer devised a solution to use this surplus of paper into a renewed material: NewspaperWood.

NewspaperWood shows a reversing of a traditional production process; not from wood to paper, but the other way around. When a NewspaperWood log is cut, the layers of paper appear like lines of a wood grain or the rings of a tree and therefore resembles the aesthetic of real wood. The material can be cut, milled and sanded and generally treated like any other type of wood.

NewspaperWood does not aim to be a large scale alternative to wood, nor to use all paper waste into a new material. The main theme in the project is ‘upcycling’ with which the manufacturers show how a surplus of material can be changed into something more valuable, just by using it in another context.

As a basic material, a local source has been used intentionally to create a local binding of the end-material with it’s resources. It also limits the transport-cycle to a minimum. Misprints and a surplus of day-old printed newspaper that has not been distributed create enough material supply to create the new material.

To actually upcycle the newspapers into the new wood-like material, the designers (temporarily) take the newspapers out of the already existing and efficient cycle of paper-recycling. It would be ideal to be able to bring the company’s waste material back into the circle again. Therefore they use a glue to construct the material which is free of solvents and plasticizers which would make it more difficult to recycle. With this it is not only possible to put our own sawing and sandpapering waste back into the circle, but also to bring the NewspaperWood products to the scrap yard for recycling.

All NewspaperWood development, production and application will be done by Vij5. There is no availability to purchase the material for third parties to work with, only to construct a project in direct cooperation with Vij5 and Mieke Meijer.","Acoustic, Sense & Sensibility, Wood",Matte,0%,Open,Medium,Hard,Medium,Moderate,Moderate,Unknown,Moderate,Poor,Moderate,Medium,Poor,Yes

The core has a high structural rigidity and a very low weight. It’s mainly used for interiors or fittings, while it is not used for structures. Nomex Decore weighs half the weight of a plywood panel with a solid section. Compared to plywood, the difference in mechanical resistance becomes very little between thicker panels (15-18 mm). The same mechanical performance can be obtained by increasing the thickness of the lightweight panel by a few millimetres. The lightweight panel is lighter and more elastic than a common plywood panel. Applications of the light-weight panel are mainly in the marine industry for the fitting out of yachts.

A problem with the light-weight panels is the core is mostly hollow, which eliminates the possibility to use screws. This can be resolved by filling one ore more hexagonals with a hardening resin or using a wood insert. Another solution is to use the Bellotti lightweight composite panels that are available in a version called “K”: these panels are built with a central plywood layer in order to resist screwing.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/noxite/,Noxite,Plastics,PLA969,Netherlands,Icopal,"This roofing membrane is able to purify the air. The Noxite process converts harmful NOx into harmless nitrates that are washed off the roof in rainwater events. It improves public health, and the environment, as the harmful pollutant is neutralised from the environment.

At first glance, a Noxite roofing membrane doesn’t look any different to the quality membranes you are used to. The surface slates/ granules of the Noxite membranes however are coated with titanium dioxide, which functions as a catalyst in the process of changing the NOx molecules into harmless levels of nitrates. The process is activated when ultraviolet radiation from the sun hits the titanium dioxide particles, releasing energy for breaking down the NOx molecules. Polluted air passes over the Noxite membrane where the NOx molecules are converted into harmless levels of water, carbon dioxide and nitrates, which are then washed away by the rain. The Noxite effect lasts for the entire life of the roof.

According to the calculations and in the best conditions, the effect can be quantified as follows : 100 m² of a Noxite roofing membrane can purify as much NOx from the air as produced by an average car travelling approx 1,000 miles per year. A 1,000m² Noxite roof could purify as much NOx from the air as produced by an average car travelling 10,000 miles every year.

Approximately 85% of each brick consists of recycled mineral waste, primarily sourced from demolition and residual construction materials. This composition contributes to resource efficiency by reintroducing secondary raw materials into the building process.

The manufacturing method differs from traditional brick production. Instead of being fired at high temperatures, NXT Bricks are produced through a cold-curing process that involves chemical hardening. During this process, carbon dioxide is absorbed and stored within the material. As a result, the overall energy demand is lower, and the process contributes to carbon storage.

Each brick has a standard size of 210 × 100 × 50 mm. The compressive strength is measured at 18 N/mm², and the bending strength at 4.00 N/mm². The volumetric mass is approximately 1950 kg/m³. Additional properties include UV resistance in accordance with DIN 51094 and verified freeze-thaw resistance, as tested by SGS. These characteristics ensure performance that meets standard requirements for use in masonry applications.

The material can be coloured during production, allowing for variations in appearance. Bricks are available in several colour options, including natural earth tones. Matching stone strips are also available to support façade and detailing work.

The production process aims for zero material waste. Due to its use of secondary raw materials and CO₂ absorption, the material is positioned as a lower-impact alternative to conventional fired bricks. Pricing is comparable to standard masonry products, making it applicable in both conventional and sustainable construction projects.

NXT Bricks are part of a range of products developed by NXT Building with a focus on circular construction materials, including concrete and partition systems. The product line supports the reuse of raw materials in the built environment, with the goal of reducing environmental pressure in the construction sector.","Recycling, Concretes, bricks, facades",Matte,0%,Closed,Coarse,Hard,Cool,Poor,None,Unknown,Good,Good,Good,,Moderate,No

https://materialdistrict.com/material/ocean-articulated/,Ocean Articulated,Other naturals,ONA1073,Switzerland,Studio Eidola,"Ocean Articulated is a recyclable and load-bearing material with locally extracted salt, sand and plant based natural binder. It is water dissoluble and sensitive to the humidity over 80%.

The self-initiated project Ocean Articulated started with a geomorphological investigation into material cycles of salt and sand/gravel, where those materials lay on each other, as remains of a prehistoric sea and deposits of glacial erosion in the High-Rhine area of the Northern Switzerland.

Considering the environmental impact of sand extraction and the associated transportation costs, the question arose whether there is a way to use sand as a reusable material and communicate this aesthetically in a form appropriate to the material.

To build objects and structural elements we used a sand casting method, which is traditionally used for casting metals. It was the ideal casting type for this project as it is a relatively simple process, enables us to use the same sand for mould building and more importantly it imprints the granular structure of the material on the objects’ surface. ‍ The initial compressive strength test proves the load-bearing capacity for the developed material and is around 15.6 MPa (mega pascal), which makes it a structural material (As a reference, a family house can be built with a material has the compressive strength around 3-4 MPa).

The objects and mould can be built layer by layer, similar to other additive manufacturing techniques. This additive ability enables the possibility to manufacture cantilever forms. The humid paste is placed into the empty space which is created in the sand mould and it partly joins with the mould surface while hardening. As a consequence of this merge, each casting produces slightly different and coincidentally transformed results. After the drying process, mould sand can be removed and the object is excavated. So far we produced a series of stools, tiles and pedestals.

Similar to the mixing and setting process, the recycling process is fairly straight-forward and the material can be easily dissolved into its raw materials, sand and salt, either by natural decomposition or rapidly with water. The temporary nature of the objects is a reminder to be careful when selecting materials and to simply borrow them from nature rather than consuming. We would like to draw attention to the concept of time in relation to the formation of materials, something people rarely consider when it comes to buying a product.","Recycling, Other naturals, salt, sand, tiles",Matte,0%,Closed,Variable,Hard,Medium,Moderate,None,Good,Good,Poor,Poor,Medium,,Yes
https://materialdistrict.com/material/oceanic/,Oceanic,Plastics,PLA1461,United Kingdom,Camira,"Oceanic is a fabric born of the SEAQUAL Initiative designed to combat marine plastic pollution and achieve a waste free environment. It is created entirely from post-consumer recycled plastic – from debris floating discarded in our seas, used to make SEAQUAL yarn, to bottles thrown away and destined for landfill.

One small drop in the mission to clean both the earth and its ocean, this contemporary fabric is a recycled polyester with a purpose. Each year, 12 million tonnes of plastic enters our oceans; equating to a truckload every single minute, the problem is growing at a rate faster than is almost possible to conceive. With experts predicting that by 2048 the amount of plastic in the seas will weigh more than the number of fish, the issue is a manmade disaster, threatening one of our most crucial life sources with every passing day.

Saving our ocean one bottle at a time, each metre of Oceanic is woven from yarn made from 26 plastic bottles. Delicately dyed using cationic yarn, this multi-tonal textile combines and contrasts a light warp with a deeply saturated weft. With an intricate twill weave, this visual detail creates a subtle pattern – enhancing both the considered colour and careful construction of the fabric.

Taking its strength from the raw material from which it was originally created, Oceanic is a highly durable textile, tough enough for a life not only on the seas but also on the seats it furnishes. Blending a soft fluidity with a high level of performance, it is ideal for inclusion in a wide range of modern interiors. With a refined colour selection of 16 shades, Oceanic combines muted, neutral hues with soft pastels and deep bolds to provide a versatile palette that echoes the shades visible on nature’s shoreline, as well as introducing a number of vibrant, trend-led tones.","Recycling, Plastics, fabric, textile",Matte,0%,Closed,Smooth,Soft,Medium,Moderate,None,Moderate,Unknown,Moderate,Moderate,Light,Moderate,No

Gelatin, one of the main ingredient, is considered less valuable within capitalism where values are determined by profitability. So it has been produced by left-overs of leather-making and meat processing whose main products are more profitable than gelatin.

For this reason, by dealing with gelatin as a main ingredient to create new materials and draw out new possibilities, designer Soowon Chae wanted to show the positive possibilities of human’s intuitive creativity.

In a similar vein, red ochre is used as not only a colouring agent but also an homage for passion and creativity of humans who previously used ochre in various ways to survive in a harsh wild life.

To realise this idea, Soowon have conducted a number of material experiments which show various potentials. By changing the temperatures, proportions and the way of pouring, different patterns, colours, textures, thickness and flexibility could have been made with only those 4 natural ingredients.

And for the coating part, natural wax was used to cover the surface for the water-repellent without using any chemical coatings.

This material can be hand-stitched or machine-sewed, so it can be used as a normal textile material. And it can be customised to leather-like, rubber/silicone-like and plastic-like by changing the proportions and the way of making.

So, with these material experiments, Soowon is keeping on the research about how to apply ocragela into the products, textiles and flooring material.","Biobased, Biodegradable, Sense & Sensibility, Other naturals",Variable,0%,Closed,Variable,Soft,Medium,Moderate,None,Moderate,Unknown,Moderate,Moderate,Medium,Moderate,Yes

The first tiles will be applied in a new groundwater production plant of Brabant Water, which is currently designed by Architecture firm Inbo. More than a thousand liters of local iron sludge will be processed to produce 10.000 tiles for a prominent wall in this building. The tiles will be applied in an artistic pattern reflecting the character of water. At this moment ceramics company Koninklijke Tichelaar is taking care of the production of the tiles. The realization of the water production plant is planned for 2023.","Recycling, Sense & Sensibility, Ceramics, tiles, walls",Variable,0%,Closed,Medium,Hard,Cool,Poor,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Heavy,,No

Oysters are increasingly popular as a delicacy, but are also cultivated for being excellent natural water filters. Designer Marjolein Stappers investigated yet another interesting feature of these versatile creatures. Struck by the beauty of their shells after savouring them at a restaurant, and noticing how they were thrown away as garbage, she came up with the idea for Oesterplat.

The name Oesterplat has been given in relation to how the oysters are still grown here in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, people mainly do soil cultivation that is spread over the 1,550 ha of land in the Oosterschelde and 500 hectares in the Grevelingenmeer.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/okagel/,Okagel,Glass,GLA252,Germany,OKALUX Glastechnik GmbH,"Okagel is a special insulating glass system. The inter-pane cavity is filled with translucent Aerogel. Thanks to its extraordinary physical properties, it is suited for many applications wherever light-diffusion and simultaneous thermal and sound insulation are demanded.

Okagel provides high quality thermal insulation. By using a light-diffusing silica aerogel in the cavity between the glass panes, Okagel enables very good light distribution within room, independent of changing irradiation conditions, together with glare protection.

The high grade thermal-insulating aerogel has an air content of around 97% and weighs just 75g per litre. Therefore, it is currently the lightest solid material and the best insulation material worldwide. The aerogel filling reduces the thermal transition in the space between the panes with regard to convection, thermal conduction and thermal radiation.

The microstructure of the aerogel is made up of a three-dimensional grid with an average pore size of around 20 Nm. This encapsulates the existing gas molecules and their movement, and also prevents any impact between them. This effectively prevents the convection as well directly stopping the thermal conduction in the gas phase. Due to the low percentage of materials, the solid state thermal conduction in the aerogel is minimal.

In addition to project-specific light transmission and total solar transmittance, Okagel offers excellent thermal insulation, good sound attenuation, UV control according to requirements, appealing appearance of insulating glass in daylight or artificial light, effect of depth when viewed from inside and outside and it is highly visible to birds.","Translucency, Glass",Glossy,50-100%,Closed,Smooth,Hard,Cool,Moderate,None,Moderate,Good,Good,Good,Heavy,Good,No

The company is releasing a leather for lovers of fine, rich and smooth natural leather. It’s called the Old Saddle collection. The leather is made from the best quality and freshest South-German bull hides. It is a pure aniline leather, which is chrome tanned and vegetable re-tanned. A special hand-rubbed finish reproduces the unique antique, rich, smooth, lustrous finish of the past. This makes the material suitable for high-end leather goods and furniture.

The leather is a natural product. It breathes and is naturally warm, with characteristics that confirm the charm and beauty of the leather. The leather has a slightly rough, natural grain breakage. The special wax makes it water- and oil resistant, though not scratch resistant.

Using the technology of a vegetable tanning process, the manufacturers have been able to recreate the characteristics of fine antique leathers, without the original limitations. The Old Saddle line combines high-quality leather, vegetable dyes and a special hand-rubbed finish, which is skilfully applied to reproduce the smooth and lustrous finish with contemporary performance.

As the leather is a natural product, scarring and blemishes are visible. Neck wrinkles, growth stripes, scratches, insect bites and different grain structures are visible guarantees of the authenticity of the material. Thanks to these characteristics dyes can penetrate into the skin in varying degrees, which results in the many colour variations in this luxurious leather.

So it is obvious that salt has a very special relationship with fluids. In chemistry this process is called osmosis. It occurs because salt is hygroscopic by nature. Translated into everyday vocabulary this means: salt always strives to dissolve – thus drawing water from its immediate surroundings. Artists use this characteristic in silk painting. Salt is sprinkled on the painted watered fabric, the salt then absorbs the liquid and with it the dissolved pigments of colour. By doing so, every grain creates a corona of lightened silk around itself. The question popped up: Does this technique work on wood?

LLot LLov transferred the effects of osmosis caused by salt onto wood. First the surface is glazed monochrome or multi-colour, then it is sprinkled with salt. The results are affected by the kind of salt used, humidity and length of reaction time. A series of experiments shows that big crystals tend to create big rims with strong contrasts, whereas fine crumbs of salt trigger more differentiated patterns with softer gradients. When combined with spruce wood, the salt draws the pigment into the natural flow of the grain, emphasizing the unique features of the original material.","Biobased, Curious, Coatings",Satin,0%,Closed,Smooth,Hard,Warm,Poor,None,Moderate,Good,Poor,Good,Medium,Moderate,Yes

In this process, various ground pollutions are caused by chemical and toxic particles resulting from some glazings. “It’s a shame that clay, one of the most natural materials, is treated in this way,” says Seok-hyeon Yoon. Technically, the clay itself is reusable as chamotte, powder of baked clay. Glassy ingredients of glazing complicate ceramic recycling. Because when they are baked as one, they fuse together. Then the earth is not pure anymore.

He thought if he can get pure earth again from recycling systems such as those of glass and plastic, the earth might be reused through re-production. So, he searched for alternative glazings and found out “Ott” known as Korean traditional lacquering material. It’s a natural resin from the Ott tree and was widely used as glazing for woodenware in the past.

To glaze Ott on the ceramic surface, it doesn’t need to be baked as it just drys out. And he discovered an interesting fact that it evaporates when it’s heated with the high temperature in kilns. It means that we can get clean earth again and reutilize it.

OCB is made in a passive process that fixes, or sequesters, the biogenic carbon in organics. Organic material breaks down as methane in landfill conditions. Diverting organic material from ending up in landfill to create OurCarbon Black avoids significant greenhouse gas emissions. For every 1 ton of OCB produced from typical US landfill, over 10 tons of CO2 emissions are prevented from entering our atmosphere.

OCB can be used in a myriad of applications as a black or gray pigment. It is currently commercially available as a polymer masterbatch pigment, a pigment for screen printing inks, a botanical style textile dye, a colorant for 3D printing filament, and as a wood stain pigment.

OurCarbon Black has the potential to replace a chemical pigment known as Carbon Black in many applications. Carbon Black is a ubiquitous chemical that’s in everything from your favorite black shirt, to your laptop keyboard, and even in every car tire on the road. This material is made by burning petrol and collecting the soot produced in the process; for every 1 ton of Carbon Black produced, there are 3 tons of CO2e emitted.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/outdoor-hemp-fabric/,Outdoor hemp fabric,Other naturals,ONA854,Netherlands,Vyva Fabrics,"Vyva Fabrics presents a new fabric line for furnishings based on fine fibres in HEMP, the perfect link between indoor and outdoor living.

Hemp is one of the most antique botanical fibres, its origin dates back to 6,000 years ago. Grown without the use of fertilisers and chemical products, it is the most suitable natural textile material for outdoor living because it is resistant to extreme weather conditions. It has been used for centuries to make cords, sails and tents.

A highly protective fibre, it filters 95% of UV rays. It is resistant to wear and tear, has dimensional and humid tenacity and stability. It is particularly popular in clothing because it is pleasant to touch, fresh and has the highest transpiration capacity in nature.

Contact with nature is the inspiration for this new fabric.

Nowadays outdoor living is much more than a trend. It’ s a way of life, a concept of spirit. It is the dimension of fluid living. Being out in the open means more living, more wellness, much more lounge and cooking. Small or large outdoor spaces reflect the character, culture and personality of whoever lives there.

Vyva Fabrics Hemp Collection is the ideal fabric for living absolutely freely every single space within the house. Its smooth equilibrium gives outdoor space the same classy elegance in living and spreads into indoor spaces like a breath of fresh air.

Hemp Collection has both anti-static and waterproof treatment that protects the fabric from ongoing climatic exposure. This means that dust and liquids slide off without penetrating the fibre, making it climate resistant. Any wind is sea wind, and when it blows it fills sails and carries you far away. Vyva Fabrics’ Hemp Collection fabrics are ready to set sail towards new horizons.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/palm-veneer/,Palm Veneer,Other naturals,ONA1079,United Arab Emirates,Reem Jeghel,"Date Palm trees have been integral to the UAE’s cultural and environmental landscape for centuries, symbolizing sustenance, resilience, and life in the arid desert. Traditionally, every part of the palm tree served a purpose—from providing shade and dates to crafting ropes and mats. In modern times, however, the agricultural waste of palm trees, particularly the husks, is often overlooked, discarded, or burned, contributing to CO2 emissions.

This project seeks to reinterpret this historical connection by transforming palm husks into Palm Veneer, a sustainable, contemporary material that highlights the richness of the UAE’s natural resources through innovative and low-tech methods. By repurposing palm fibre waste from Abu Dhabi’s date palm trees, which are trimmed 1-2 times annually to maintain their health, the material offers a creative solution to agricultural waste, reducing emissions and promoting sustainability.

Palm Veneer demonstrates the versatility and potential of palm fibres in products and interiors, while also supporting the local market and empowering workers. The process involves shredding the tough fibers of palm husks, a critical pre-treatment that accelerates their decomposition if used as mulch or soil fertilizer. The material’s cradle-to-cradle lifecycle ensures that even at the end of its use, it contributes to soil fertility—suppressing weeds, reducing water evaporation, and slowly releasing nutrients back into the earth.

By introducing innovative techniques, this project transforms waste into opportunity, fostering a sustainable future while honoring the enduring connection between the UAE and its iconic date palm trees.","Biobased, Other naturals, palm",Matte,0-50%,Open,Coarse,Resilient,Warm,Good,Moderate,Moderate,Moderate,Moderate,Good,Light,Poor,Yes

https://materialdistrict.com/material/palmleather/,Palmleather,Other naturals,ONA456,Netherlands,Studio Tjeerd Veenhoven,"Palmleather is a material innovation by Dutch designer Tjeerd Veenhoven that makes use of leaves from the Areca Betel Nut Palm. This palm variety grows throughout some of India’s poorest regions and sheds over 80 million square meters of leaves each year. While these leaves are an incredible material resource, they are unfortunately rarely used – partly because they become very dry and brittle in their raw state. Veenhoven however has developed a biological solution for softening these palm leaves, resulting in a plant-based material that is flexible and soft, with the feel of leather.

Offering a viable alternative to animal-based leathers, palmleather can be produced with far less pollution than other leathers. Products developed by the studio include bags, shoes, book covers and Palmetti, a fully biodegradable slipper for the hospitality industry. The latest contribution are the Palmleather Filigree Rugs, a novel way of using these leaves in carpets and rugs for any living space.

The palms do not grow thicker in the course of time, only taller. Every part of the coconut palm can be used, from the leaves used for building roofs, to the processing of the trunk for wood. The most important use of the coconut palm however is for the production of coconuts (fibres, coconut milk, copra, and coconut oil). A coconut palm lives for several decades. As it ages, the palm produces smaller and smaller coconuts.

It is usually too expensive for the owner to plant a new tree because it takes a very long time before they bear nuts. By buying in old trees, which in fact are of excellent wood quality, new trees with higher productivity can be planted without posing a financial risk for the owner. The trees are then brought to the sawmill and the bottom part of the palm trunk is processed into coconut wood or (in the case of sugar palms) into vases. The trunk of the coconut palm has a different structure from other wood trees. The outer surface of the trunk has a hard layer that is used as wood. This coconut wood is a relatively hard, dark wood type with a unique grain structure, without growth rings. Coconut wood is one of the most durable wood types in the world.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/paper-waste-panel/,Paper Waste Panel,Other naturals,ONA1107,Netherlands,FRONT® Materials,"Paper Waste Panels are an innovative interior finishing material crafted from repurposed industrial fibre waste. They are made primarily from cellulose fibres that have become too short for conventional recycling, combined with 25% post-consumer cardboard. Without intervention, these fibres would typically end up as landfill waste, contributing to environmental pollution. Instead, Paper Waste Panels offer a sustainable alternative to traditional wall cladding and composite materials.

By repurposing these fibres, Paper Waste Panels help to reduce waste while maintaining durability and functionality. Every 100 square meters of panels produced prevents 722 kilograms of waste from being discarded. The panels are non-toxic, recyclable, and free of synthetic resins, ensuring minimal environmental impact throughout their lifecycle.

The production process involves mixing fibres with water to create a pulp, which is then pressed and dried into stable, rigid boards. The process requires no fossil fuels and is powered by renewable energy sources, significantly lowering its carbon footprint. The result is a high-quality, long-lasting material suitable for various interior applications.

Paper Waste Panels are designed for easy installation and come in multiple surface patterns and colours. The standard collection includes three textures—Drop, Line, and Stripe—and five natural tones: Natural, Terracotta, Cement, Graphite, and Olive. Custom options are available for large-scale projects.

Looking ahead, a recycling program is in development to further extend the lifecycle of these panels. Used panels can be collected, processed, and reintegrated into new products, reinforcing a circular economy model. With their unique aesthetic, strong environmental credentials, and practical versatility, Paper Waste Panels provide a forward-thinking solution for sustainable interior design.","Biobased, Other naturals, walls",Matte,0%,Closed,Medium,Hard,Medium,Moderate,None,Moderate,Unknown,Moderate,Moderate,Medium,Moderate,Yes

The patterned product is then always levelled and processed for optimum flatness.

Aesthetically, these patterned finishes provide a large selection of random and symmetrical designs that are modern and attractive in appearance. By producing this product, it eliminates defects like oil canning which can be reduced by using the patterned finishes to provide improved optical flatness thus making the product ideal for cladding systems.

The presence of a patterned finish will also hide scratches, dents and other impact damage, unlike plain flat and polished metals which too readily reveal the lightest of impact. These finishes are tried and tested, having been used for over 40 years because of their anti-vandal and durability properties.

As a direct consequence of the strength and durability benefits provided by the patterned finishes, long term cost savings are provided in maintenance and replacement of applications such as elevators, columns and doors, etc.

This patterning process also provides a reduced contact area on each sheet, therefore reducing friction problems common in food, drink and photographic machinery. This can then significantly speed up production flow.

The appliance industry also uses these patterned finishes because they provide heat insulation and dissipation advantages as well as increasing the strength and rigidity of metal enabling lighter gauges to be used with consequent cost and weight savings.

Thanks to the colour used on different parts of the tile, the observer will have different aesthetic perceptions as he/she moves through the space. The project stems from a reflection on the relationship between space (public or private) and its users.

This project establishes a relationship between the architectural places of the contemporary city and the perception of each individual. Therefore, it originates a dialogue amongst the viewer and the context, which enhances the physical differences of both places and people. A game of prospective allows to catch different realities from different angles. Elements that from there seem totally disharmonic, just two steps further blend themselves together in an equilibrium, giving the perception of the movement as mutation.

PET stands for Polyethylene Terephthalate. This soft felt material comes from recycled PET bottles and can be used in many ways for the interior. Think of wall panels, acoustic screens or ceiling elements. Acoustic Trend offers high quality acoustic PET Felt panels for offices, shops, restaurants, hotels, gyms etc. They are strong, flexible and lightweight felt sheets. The panels can be ordered in variable sizes and thicknesses. You can also choose from over 40 colours. This gives a large degree of design freedom.

Sound absorption felt panel The PET Felt panels are ideal for improving the acoustics within a room. Due to the porous nature of the felt, the panel is sound absorbing and thermally insulating. Good acoustics depend on the use of the materials in a room. With many smooth and hard materials such as glass, stone or cast floors, the sound is fully reflected, resulting in a high reverberation. It is therefore important to also use soft and sound-absorbing materials in the room. PET Felt then offers the solution. These felt panels give designers both aesthetic and noise-reducing solutions.

Applications Acoustic Pet Felt PET Felt is made of felt and can be placed on the ceiling, wall or as a separate element in the room. You can have the panel milled or printed. Ideal as sheet material for further processing. For example, use the plates for furniture, hubs, call cells or as a decorative hanging panel. The panels are easy to install or hang. The suspension materials are delivered together with the panels (with the exception of the glue). Think of adjustable suspension wire, cables and Z-clips.

Available as a panel or in a beautiful design. This acoustic felt is made of 100% polyester fibres. A large part of this is recycled polyester (up to 50%). This also makes this acoustic material a sustainable choice!

The polyester fibres are pressed into thin layers. Due to a high density of fibres, the panels are very strong and hard. The material is available in different thicknesses and dimensions. EASYfelt offers 9, 12 and 25 mm. In addition, each thickness has its own colour range.

PET felt panels and design PET felt panels are beautiful and can be easily made into the most beautiful creations. With their own R&D team, EASYfelt develops new, stylish products for both the business and private sectors. The range includes wall panels, felt panels for the ceiling, baffles, screens and other objects.

EASYfelt’s package includes over 50 colours, most of which are available from stock. By combining thickness, colour, size and shape, it is possible to produce the most unusual and versatile creations on the wall, ceiling or freestanding in the room.

Want to buy thick felt? Want to buy thick felt? Then you’ve come to the right place. EASYfelt sells PET felt with a thickness of 9 mm, 12 mm or 25 mm. Which thickness is best depends on the following:

Acoustic felt Recycled felt has very good acoustic properties, which makes it ideal for improving acoustics. Here it is true that: the thicker, the better the acoustics. For an optimal result, EASYfelt recommends installing felt acoustic panels on a cavity of approximately 25 mm. This increases the acoustic values enormously.

Please note that this material on the wall helps to improve the acoustics in the room. When EASYfelt talks about sound-absorbing felt as sound insulation or felt acoustic insulation, they mean an improvement of the acoustics by reducing reverberation. Sound-absorbing felt is therefore very suitable in rooms that sound hollow. Please note: it is not suitable for noise nuisance from neighbours.

Felt on the wall or ceiling? Acoustic felt can be applied to both the wall and the ceiling. On the wall, you apply acoustic felt panels. This can be done in the form of a panel but also as felt wallpaper. When you choose felt wallpaper, you can cover the entire wall with connecting felt panels. A material that is very suitable for this is the EASYfelt Stick.

Self-adhesive felt Most products have a self-adhesive film that makes them easy to apply. In this case, the products have a protective film just like a sticker with an adhesive layer behind it.

An example of self-adhesive felt with an adhesive layer is the EASYfelt Stick. This PET felt with a self-adhesive layer is very suitable for easily adding a wall decoration to an entire wall.","Acoustic, Plastics",Matte,0%,Open,Medium,Resilient,Medium,Good,None,Good,Unknown,Poor,Poor,Light,Poor,No

https://materialdistrict.com/material/phellem-collection/,Phellem collection,Other naturals,ONA1008,Italy,Alcarol,"Phellem is the outermost layer of the tree bark, similar in many ways to our own skin. Although quite conspicuous and essential for the protection of the tree, bark has been much less studied and used than wood.

This collection treatises on its incredibly fascinating biodiversity offering any range of colours and textures. The bark of a tree is as individual as a fingerprint and its polymorphism – variety in pattern and colour – is simply stunning.

These skins are strongly characterized and made different by genetics of each individual wood species as well as the environment and the organisms grew up in it. The bark of different trees has evolved to make best use of the habitat in which each species occurs, the main function is always to protect the arboreal body keeping the vital layers away from temperature and external stress.

When bark is damaged a natural defense mechanism intervenes, a complex liquid substance hardens in contact with air creating a sort of conservative barrier keeping the vital wood layers away from bacteria, fungi and parasites. It’s the resin. In a similar way, alcarol preserves the bark of different species covering them with an innovative bio-sourced transparent resin, functional declination of the tree’s natural process.

This flat and clear layer allows you to appreciate the intact botanical variety of the organic matter, frozen as it appears in its original habitat. The interlocking compositions refer to the ancient wood inlay technique, which has always sought the most different woods to get the maximum expressive possibilities.","Biobased, Other naturals, tree bark",Glossy,0-50%,Closed,Smooth,Hard,Medium,Poor,None,Unknown,Good,Moderate,Good,Medium,Moderate,Yes
https://materialdistrict.com/material/phenol-sodium-ascorbate-developer/,Phenol Sodium Ascorbate Developer,Coatings,COA301,Netherlands,Giulia Principe Studio,"This project investigates the toxic nature of analogue photographic processes and the sustainable alternatives that are available. Due to the mishandling of special and toxic waste, a significant amount of territory in the south of Italy and numerous countries in the African continent are severely polluted. The levels of toxicity in the land and air affect the local communities with diseases and disrupt the quality of locally grown produce. Analogue photography plays a part in the pollution of the territories in which it is operated, creating the need for a sustainable alternative.

The photographic method comprises three chemical processes – development, stop, fixing – which utilise harmful substances to this day, to which very few alternatives are available in the market and none are able to replace the process in its entirety in an eco-friendly way. Studies demonstrate that ascorbic acid (vitamin C) has the ability to reduce silver ions, proving its action as a developing agent, first patented by Heinz Ohle in 1932. Ascorbic acid, like hydroquinone – the substance found in commercially available film and paper developers, acts more strongly at higher solution alkalinities giving images with a low fogging result. Sodium carbonate/bicarbonate (soda) works as a pH adjusting agent in combination with ascorbic acid bonding in sodium ascorbate.

Working in conjunction with sodium, ascorbate is a polyphenolic compound extracted naturally from a variety of sources, from fungi to the plant kingdom. Phenol extraction may involve water and/or ethanol, depending on the polarity of the source. Alcohol used in fresh plant preparations dehydrates the plant cells, pulling all the constituents out of the plant and into solution.

The resulting developer mixture works in reducing silver halides on black and white film and paper and produces high quality images as well as its commercial adversary. The second part of the process – stop – acts as an intermediate chemical bath to halt the action of the developer and offer a cross contamination barrier with the following fixer bath. A highly acidic solution is necessary to perform as a stop, and the simplest alternative to the market counterpart is a mixture of water/rain water and acidic elements such as vinegar, citric acid or lemon juice.

The fixer stabilises the image, removing the unexposed silver halide remaining on the photographic film or photographic paper, rendering it no longer photo-sensitive. The prime ingredient of the fixing solution is ammonium thiosulfate, which is not classified as environmentally hazardous, however, this does not eliminate the possibility that excessive or large spills can have harmful or damaging effects on the environment. Additionally, it is classified as a HDP – Hazardous Decomposition Products: heating this product will evolve ammonia. Ammonia (16-25%) may form flammable mixtures in air. Heating to dryness will cause production of ammonia, oxides of sulphur, ammonium sulfate and its compounds are discharged into the receiving body of water, it endangers fish life, even at a relatively low concentration.

The most known eco-friendly substitute is the salt fixer, a highly saturated salt water solution. Its action is however extremely slow and potentially inefficient in the long term. The artist collaborates with chemists to find ways to boost the action of the salt fixer adding MSM (methyl sulfone) which has many claims of benefits in healthcare and beauty products as a sulphur supplement for diet, it is naturally sourced in garlic, onions, legumes, cruciferous veggies. Adding other salts such as potassium bromide can also accelerate the action of the salt fixer and, when used in developers in small quantities, may act as a fog restrainer due to its ability to differentiate between exposed and unexposed crystals of silver halide.","Biobased, Ecology, Coatings, photographs",Variable,100%,Open,Variable,Soft,Medium,,Moderate,Unknown,Poor,Poor,Moderate,Light,Poor,Yes

https://materialdistrict.com/material/photoglas/,Photoglas,Glass,GLA064,Austria,Photoglas GmbH,"Profile Photoglas office is an atelier which develops ideas, concepts, draft designs and realisations in the architecture and museum domain. Photoglas technology was developed – and subsequently patented – in 1997 for a permanent site-specific intervention. The aim was to explore unifying photography, glass and light. Light thus constitutes a key element in the work and characterizes, or changes, the space. The sculptures emanating from this process form part of a series of spatial studies which are elaborated for both the interior and the exterior area. The result is a specific atmosphere which continuously transforms as the light travels.

Photoglas services encompass the project’s artistic conceptualisation, design development and technical realisation. Projects are also developed in close cooperation with architecture firms, institutes, research labs, universities and museums. The office’s art directors are Bele Marx & Gilles Mussard. Depending on the project requirements, the team is enlarged to include experts from different disciplines, such as museology, history, architecture, photo and illumination engineering, chemistry, etc.

Quality Quality of glass: laminated safety glass (with tempered glass, white glass, satinato, antireflective glass …) The lifespan of laminated glass panes numbers several decades. According to the Ilford tests, the material remains light-resistant for over 100 years in the case of indoor application, 25 to 30 years in case of direct exposure to sunlight (e.g., windows), and for several centuries when kept under archive conditions. Photoglas demonstrates durability and quality of image reproduction that is far superior to similar products available on the market and thereby satisfies a need for durable solutions that work with colour, light and transparency.

Focus Artificial light or natural light is integrated as an essential conceptual element, effecting a visual change in both the interior space and the exterior space. The space sculptures emanating from this process work with the linkage of light and colour. Through projected colour shadows the light source produces an active space which continuously changes along with it.

Work continues with partners for the further development of the Photoglas technology, which is tested in pilot projects. Along with this, research is carried out with different glass qualities and light techniques, as well as with colour analyses, in order to achieve state-of-the-art results. read more 1 2 3",Glass,Glossy,0-50%,Open,Smooth,Hard,Medium,Poor,None,Moderate,Good,Good,Good,Heavy,Moderate,No

The UV sensitive product line by Matsui is available in three reversible colours: yellow, purple and blue. Each colourant comes as a powdered form with a light colour.

The colours are activated when exposed to the sun or other ultraviolet light sources and then change from clear to colour. They change back to clear when the ultraviolet light source is removed.

The coating is available in an AQ and gravure ink formats, plastic resin concentrates, PVC spray and powders. The powder is insoluble in water but is soluble in most organic solvents.

For moulding purposes, the coating is heated and kneaded into a resin such as polypropylene or polyethylene. EVA and K-resin can also be used. Moulding the mixture of colourant and resin can be performed with injection moulding, blow moulding or extrusion machines.

For preparation, each colour has a different melting point. Yellow melts around 162 °C, purple around 237 °C and blue around 257 °C.

Using other white pigmen6ts together will also decrease concentration of colour exhibition through light and light fastness. For moulding with a high concentration of colour exhibition, the manufacturer recommends mixing the ink into a transparent plastic.

Nero Belgio belongs to the stones which are mined as Marble in the natural stone country Belgium. Sometimes Nero Belgio also is called as Noir De Belgique, Nero Del Belgio Pillow White is made from Lasa Marble which is extracted from the Nördersberg near Laas (Lasa) in South Tyrol (Alto Adige) in the very north of Italy.

It is an exceptionally hard, durable, resistant material which wears well in adverse weather conditions. It began earning a prestigious reputation for itself around the middle of the XIX century and has been known as Tyrolean Marble or Vinschgau Valley Marble over the years. It owes much of its fame to having been presented by two merchants of the Imperial Geological Office at the Vienna World Exhibition in the year 1873 The Lasa marble varies in texture depending on the extraction site. The one from the Laas (Lasa) valley quarries is particularly smooth-grained and therefore considerably more prestigious and refined.

The Lasa marble offers a 20% higher hardness coefficient compared to the Carrara marble. Thanks to these features, the Lasa marble has become particularly important for the export trade and is generally defined as the best, most beautiful and decorative marble available on the international market. The crystalline structure of limestone makes this natural rock extraordinarily robust and resistant to weather related deterioration.

Tests conducted on the material back in the 1950’s have shown that the Lasa marble has a higher hardness and wear resistance than any other marble in the world. A 1983 survey conducted by Munich’s National Institute for Testing revealed that the Lasa marble is resistant to both ice and salt. The Lasa marble is extremely hard, resistant to both pressure and cracking thanks to the high cohesion factor between each individual crystal. The latter characteristic also ensures the marble is almost completely rainproof.",Natural stones,Glossy,0%,Open,Smooth,Hard,Cool,Poor,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Heavy,Moderate,No

https://materialdistrict.com/material/pine-needle-paper/,Pine needle paper,Other naturals,ONA602,Germany,Katharina Jebsen,"During holiday travels in France, self-employed textile designer Katharina Jebsen came up with the idea of using pine needles as a raw material for textile experiments. Once back from her holiday, she began to experiment with indigenous pine needles – and what emerged are wonderfully scented papers and fabrics. When we think of pine needles, we think of green forests or natural remedies such as pine needle oil. The textile sector has hardly used them at all up to now, but this humble and rapidly renewable raw material falls from the trees in huge quantities.

Jebsen investigated the properties of pine needles for her Master’s thesis “My Way” as part of her course in Conceptual Textile Design at the Burg Giebichenstein University of Art and Design in Halle, Germany. She posed the question as to what possibilities pine needles offer for creating surface materials. In the process, her ideas ranged from sheet materials for interior and exterior use, vessels and containers, to textile fabrics for interior furnishings and clothing. Turning this raw material into a useful form for the textile industry harbours huge potential. It is the fine, inner fibres in the pine needles, without the dry exterior leaves, that are used here to make paper. Pine is the second most common type of tree in Germany, after the spruce, so there is no shortage of pine needles. Tapping into this organic, biologically degradable resource is, moreover, a simple matter, involving cooperations with branches of industry that use the wood from the pines, but not their needles. And the use of pine needles is said to have another significant benefit, when we think how effective the essential oils in pine needles are at keeping insects such as moths at bay.

In her Master’s thesis, Jebsen goes into the details of how to open up the needles. In the process, new types of material emerge, which can be used as the basis for further material mixes. The results of this materials study can, in turn, be transferred to various types of needles. For example, it has been shown that the needles of the fir tree, too, can be used in the printing of textiles.","Biobased, Lightweight, Other naturals",Matte,0%,Closed,Smooth,Soft,Warm,Moderate,Moderate,Poor,Moderate,Poor,Poor,Light,Moderate,Yes

https://materialdistrict.com/material/pineskins/,PineSkins,Other naturals,ONA778,Germany,Studio Sarmīte,"PineSkins, as the name suggests, is the skin of a pine tree. This leather-like material surprises with its softness in contrast to the thick and harsh character associated with pine trees. Fresh bark is treated with natural ingredients that preserve its softness. Afterwards, it can be coated with an enriching layer of finishing and colour pigments.

The tree industry has turned into a mass production factory: they grow only a few species of trees until a certain age. In fact, they refer to growing trees as cubic meters of wood rather than using the word “tree”. Finally, when the trees are cut, then it is mainly wood that is utilised. That leaves all the other parts of the tree unused. This reduces not only the diversity of materials considered for applications, but also tree species in forests. In the timber industry, pine trees are valued for their cheap wood, while the bark of the tree is discarded as waste. This project gives the bark a new purpose.

The pine bark differs from traditionally used tree barks; it cannot be harvested from a living tree. A pine tree would die without its skin. Therefore, the bark is harvested in collaboration with a tree cutter. Harvesting takes place right after the tree is felled. Each piece of bark has a unique pattern, amount of holes derived from the branches and a width depending on the size and age of the tree.","Biobased, Sense & Sensibility, Sustainable, Other naturals, bark",Glossy,0%,Closed,Coarse,Soft,Warm,Moderate,Moderate,Unknown,Good,Moderate,Moderate,Light,Moderate,Yes

Thousands of families in the region have survival linked to their capture and conservation.

The use of its skin to produce leather in a sustainable way contributes to the preservation of the species and the increase of the income of indigenous and riverside community, guaranteeing a better quality of life for their families and local communities.

Acknowledged as a true pioneer in the field of organic, metal-free tanning, the tannery, Nova Kaeru, skillfully combines a refined aesthetic taste with the utmost respect for the surrounding ecosystem and environment. At Nova Kaeru, all fish skins are processed from food industry waste and regulated by the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA), by tracking products from suppliers that maintain sanitary standards international and welfare practices, helping to protect fishers / breeders, families, and nature.

Preserving the Pirarucu Fish, Preserving the Amazon, Fighting for Life In the Amazon, after over more than 20 years of hard work with partners and environmental preservation institutes, Nova Kaeru has managed to reverse pirarucu predatory fishing and transform an endangered species into a fish with a large and wild free population and guaranteed reproduction.

As a result of this internationally recognized work, today the pirarucu is fished following the strictest sustainable fishing standards practices required by IBAMA and international bodies such as CITES. This work has ensured an increase of over 425% of fish availability in the Amazon.

By creating an important income for the local community, this sustainable management program helps not only to protect the species, but also the Amazon Forest, because it keeps locals away from deforestation and illegal mining in the region. Pirarucu is life, is environmental preservation, is zero deforestation.

Characteristics, Caring And Conservation From the tanning that uses zero heavy chemicals, environmentally safe – based on a blend of biodegradable acrylic resins, polymers, glutaraldehyde, synthetic & vegetable tannins – to the natural dyeing in aniline: the water that runs out of the tannery after treatment goes straight to irrigation.

Organic Leather / Durability: Nova Kaeru works exclusively with organic processing and bio leathers. In a comparison with leathers processed in the traditional method, which have heavy metals in their formulation, the durability is similar, and the essential difference is that at the end of its life cycle, being biodegradable, Nova Kaeru leathers will reintegrate with nature in a much higher speed than traditional hides and without any contamination of heavy metals.

Isovlas Building insulation for roof, wall and floor: optimally durable, cheap, healthy and easy to process. The insulation is based on flax, because flax is: – short cyclically renewable and recoverable – removes and stores CO2 from the atmosphere – is naturally temperature and moisture regulating – does not contain harmful dust particles – is recyclable

Technically, ecologically, and economically, Isovlas is demonstrably the most innovative and best building insulation. Isovlas offers developers, governments, housing associations, architects, contractors, processors and last but not least end users specific, new benefits.

The ideal living environment Isovlas PL and PN building insulation is the best insulation choice for your projects. Isovlas PL and PN building insulation is ideally suited for passive houses and zero-energy houses. Isovlas Building Insulation is available in PL and PN.

Isovlas PL and PN have an unparalleled temperature damping factor, thus heat storage capacity. In summer, at a temperature of 30˚C outside, this can result in an indoor temperature of approximately 23˚C (with mineral wool this is approximately 28˚C). In winter, the opposite applies: at -5˚C it stays within 21˚C with Isovlas PL, while with mineral wool it is 19˚C. By insulating or post-insulating everything with Isovlas, you create a comfortable indoor climate. Isovlas as (post) insulation is therefore just as logical as it is ingenious, also in the light of the Building Decree.

What is the difference between PL & PN Isovlas PL mainly insulation in light construction construction HSB and post-insulation such as wall, roof and floor. Isovlas PL is a stock product, Isovlas PN is available on request and more for cavity wall insulation and for slimmer constructions. The difference is in density, insulation value (lambda value) and price.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/pla851/,Hydrospan,Plastics,PLA851,United States,Industrial Polymers Corporation,"HydroSpan 100 can enlarge any shape or design in near perfect proportion and detail. When parts cast from HydroSpan are soaked in water, they accurately increase in size by 60%. By producing a series of progressively larger silicon molds, exponential growth of the original shape can be achieved.This material was originally created for artists needing a fast and economical way of enlarging seashells, fossils and other items for museum exhibits.

So how does it work? HydroSpan 100 is a flexible urethane casting resin. When liquid water touches the surface of HydroSpan, it is attracted to the atomic charge of the polymer molecules. As the water is absorbed, the polymer matrix stretches uniformly in all directions in order to accommodate the incoming water. The absorbed water is held so tightly inside that the material appears almost dry to the touch when fully expanded. Even cutting or crushing the polymer will not easily release liquid water. Through this process, HydroSpan produces near perfect expansion of molded shapes.

HydroSpan 100 is a safe and easy to use 2 component flexible urethane. It is non-hazardous for shipping purposes and produces no odor. It has a mix ratio of 2 parts A to 1 part B component by measured by volume.

The resins can be used as a binder in composites and wood panels, and as a basis for coatings and foams. Plantics resins are based on a revolutionary invention by the University of Amsterdam. It is the world’s first thermoset resin entirely produced from biomass and it is also recyclable. The raw materials for the bio-resins are derived from plant-based waste or by-products. These materials are worldwide available on an industrial scale. The resins, applications and recycling technology are worldwide protected with patents.

Circular Economy Through the growth of plants CO2 is stored, which makes the resin CO2-negative. The resin is also free from toxic raw materials, making it safe for humans, animals, and the environment. Moreover, the Plantics bio-resin and materials are fully recyclable which enables 100% re-use of the materials. This is unique as normal thermoset resins are not recyclable. Moreover, if the resin ends up in nature it is biodegradable. Plantics bio-resin serves as a sustainable alternative to traditional fossil fuel containing toxic elements such as formaldehyde, isocyanates, and epoxides. Therefore, Plantics’ various products supports the transition towards a circular economy.

Wide range of applications The Plantics bio-resin developed by Plantics has a wide range of applications. Essentially, Plantics creates three materials using the bio-resin: coatings, composites, and foams. The resin acts as a coating for recycled paper-based plant pots in order to enable a plastic-free cultivation of flowers and plants. When the resin is combined with (natural) fibrous materials it creates a wood-like composite product. For example, from non-woven hemp fibers combined with the Plantics bio-resin can be shaped to 3D objects such as chairs, barstools, traffic signs and service trays. Also, within the wood panel industry the Plantics bio-resin can be used to produce biobased chipboard, plywood, and sandwich panels which can be used in building and construction. Additionally, the bio-resin serves as a raw material for insulation foams. Therefore, Plantics bio-resin forms the basis of sustainable biobased materials capable of replacing toxic, non-renewable and non-recyclable binders in construction materials such as PUR, plywood, and chipboard.","Biobased, Other naturals, bioresin, thermosetting resin",Variable,50-100%,Open,Medium,Hard,Warm,Good,None,Moderate,Good,Good,Good,Medium,Good,Yes

By combing geological components with an artificial material, a new type of rock is created. The tiles are the result of an investigation of how lightweight post-consumer plastic packaging could be turned to look like natural stone.

The tiles are the product of a project trying to answer the questions “What is waste?” and “Where is ‘away’?”.

In addition, she believes there is no such thing as ‘away’, as the majority of plastic waste ends up in the sea.

By focusing on post-consumer plastic waste, Akiev wants to change the perception of waste and show its unique aesthetics, thus increasing the value of disposable packaging waste and making it accessible as aesthetically pleasing and durable material.

In all of its forms, PLECTERE introduces texture and warmth to workspaces, dampens sounds through its excellent acoustic properties and contributes to a better employee experience.

PLECTERE is characterized by a visually attractive 3D structure with an intriguing, repeating pattern. It exhibits a remarkable acoustic function by weaving the felt into a 3D structure. Because of its transparency, users can demarcate spaces without completely sealing them off. When PLECTERE is hung in front of a glass wall with a spatial cavity, it absorbs both high and low frequency sound waves.

PLECTERE acoustic room dividers embody a new application for the venerable material felt: the result is design innovation for the material and its applied technique.

Noise and distractions in the workplace consistently come up in the top factors that affect people’s wellbeing. Enhanced privacy, acoustics, comfort and tactility, help employees not only to feel better, but also perform better.

As a highly flexible product, PLECTERE can be introduced at any point in the design process as semi transparent space dividers to delineate different work areas. It can also be applied to existing workspaces to specify work areas while providing more privacy and comfort. It is easily relocated, so it can adapt to the changing demands of the environment.

The typical slotted absorbers actually create visual noise: a typical acoustic panel contains 30-40% of machined incisions in the materials, causing visual distraction. WAVY Acoustic is an acoustically engineered wood product with a focus on sound-noise improvement, that can easily transform a space into visual and acoustic intimacy through its seamless and organic appearance.

WAVY Acoustic incorporates room acoustics into architecture, with a Noise Reduction Coefficient rating of 0.80. It is designed by Kenichi Sato of PLY PROJECT Berlin. The material is surprisingly flexible, lightweight and has an organic design. By combining the strength of plywood with foam and technical ingenuity, WAVY turns what was once stiff and heavy into a stunning soft and lightweight material.

WAVY Acoustic is innovative, flexible panelling materials that are simple to use in interior architecture. The individual panel is manufactured from precisely cut plywood and foam sandwiches that give a slightly springy, resilient structure and a surface tactility. The result is flat or curved surfaces that provide not only an aesthetic and organically natural appearance, but also urge reassessment of engineered wood. The panels work as a sound diffuser and sound absorber. This makes the product very suitable for improving the acoustics in a room.

Polymorph belongs to a class of polymers known as caprolactones. Featuring a low fusing temperature of around 60˚C, Polymorph transforms into a material that can be moulded into almost any shape when submerged in hot water. Upon cooling, it becomes a very tough, nylon-like polymer. As it is a thermoplastic, Polymorph can be re-heated and thermoformed numerous times.

Thermoplastic, non-toxic and biodegradable, Polymorph is normally supplied in small pellets. When heat is applied, the pellets fuse and turn from opaque to clear. This fused material can then be moulded in many ways and stays workable until a much lower temperature. When fully cooled, Polymorph is very similar in its appearance and physical properties to a broad range of polythenes, however it is stiffer, stronger and tougher than the polythene used in most domestic products.

Because it is a thermoplastic, it is possible to mould Polymorph around inserts or into components that would otherwise be extremely difficult to achieve. Example applications include orthopaedic splints, ergonomic handles, moulds for vacuum forming, trainer/shoe components and sports protective clothing.","Curious, High-tech, Plastics",Matte,0-50%,Closed,Smooth,Resilient,Warm,Poor,None,Unknown,Moderate,Moderate,Moderate,Light,Moderate,No

Material Composition and Environmental Impact BioPuff® is derived from Typha fibre, a plant cultivated on regenerated wetlands. The material is processed mechanically without chemical treatments, maintaining its natural properties. The inclusion of 40% recycled polyester with enhanced biodegradability ensures that the product aligns with circular economy principles. Biodegradation testing shows that the polyester component decomposes significantly over time in various environments, reducing long-term waste.

BioPuff® contributes to wetland restoration by supporting paludiculture practices, which help sequester carbon, enhance biodiversity, and improve water management. Research indicates that re-wetting 3% of European agricultural wetlands could reduce agricultural emissions by 25%.

Performance and Certification BioPuff® provides thermal resistance comparable to traditional insulation materials, with a value of 0.8250 K*m2/W. It has passed migration, durability, and moisture retention tests, demonstrating its suitability for long-term use in textile applications. The material meets Cradle to Cradle Gold certification and complies with the Global Recycled Standard (GRS).

Application and Care Guidelines BioPuff® is available in loose fill and wadding formats. Loose fill is suited for garments requiring high loft, while BioPuff® Wadding (80% Typha, 20% recycled polyester) provides structured padding. The material integrates into existing textile manufacturing processes and is compatible with sew-through baffle construction.

To maintain performance, Ponda recommends delicate dry cleaning or washing at low temperatures with plant-based detergents. Excessive washing may impact the natural waxes in the fibre, which contribute to water resistance.

Sustainability Metrics Lifecycle analysis indicates that BioPuff® has an 88% lower impact than goose down and a 19% lower impact than polyester insulation.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/power-coating/,Powder Coating,Coatings,COA076,Canada,Alliance Surface Finishing Inc.,"Alliance powder coating is a green manufacturing process. There are no VOC’s (Volatile Organic Compounds) nor HAP’s (Hazardous Air Pollutants) emitted through this process. In most instances the paint over spray can be reclaimed and reused, which can mean a transfer efficiency or paint usage greater than 95%. Two coats of paint can be applied in a single booth, with a subsequent co-cure. This significantly reduces the carbon footprint with significantly less curing time required.

This powder coating has high durability and, in case of impact it provides high mark and scratch resistance. Good chemical resistance. Powder is suited for both indoor as well as all exterior applications.

A wide selection of metallic; texture and solid color painted finishes is available. With the Alliance “AG” (Automotive Grade) technologies, Alliance is able to produce finishes meeting the standards in the automotive industry. Furthermore the use of powder allows a great transfer efficiency of paint, without requiring the expensive capital and operation costs of pollution abatement systems.

Alliance powder technologies allow the powder coating of almost all heat sensitive substrates: Traditional Temperature cure – 175 Celsius (PA, PBT, Glass, SMC) Low Temperature cure – 120 Celsius (TPO, PP, PC) Ultra Low Temperature Cure – 100 Celsius (ABS, PP, PVC)

As its name suggests, it has a relatively flat structure, measuring approximately 1 to 2 cm in height. Pillowmoss (Leucobryum glaucum), also referred to as pincushion moss, is a leafy moss commonly found in Europe. It typically grows in globular shapes, with a thickness of 1 to 6 cm and a diameter ranging from 5 to 25 cm.

Properties & Processing After harvesting, the moss is carefully dried, preserved, and coloured using eco-friendly methods in Moswand.eu’s own production facilities. This makes it permanently soft, elastic, dirt-repellent, and fire-retardant, while ensuring it is no longer living. Treated using an immersion technique, the preservation process penetrates the entire moss structure rather than just the surface, guaranteeing an exceptionally long lifespan. The production process is energy-neutral, relying on sustainable practices free from harmful substances and fossil fuels. Both types of mosses are available in several shades of green.

It doesn’t come as a surprise that the development of true sustainable façade materials has been proven difficult. Recently, the company Pretty Plastic has developed a tile that consists entirely of recycled PVC building material waste. Because only waste streams are being used in the production process, every tile is slightly different, which gives façades a natural look.

PrettyPlastic© is a cladding material that gives discarded building products a second life. Made of old window frames, downspouts, and rain gutters, PrettyPlastic© shows that waste can become beautiful. The tiles are fully fireproof certified and can be applied on any building. By both cleaning up waste streams and producing a cladding material that can be endlessly recycled in the future, the PrettyPlastic© tile truly contributes to a circular economy: from trash to tile. Over and over again.

PrettyPlastic® is made out of 100% upcycled plastic collected from waste from the building sector. So your tiles might have been a window or a water pipe in an earlier life. Pretty Plastic© facade tiles are made out of PVC due to its great qualities in regards to fire-, weather- and UV-resistance.

The company is currently also testing other types of recycled plastic for interior and exterior tiles and will be adding those in the future.

Annelise Payne sourced and cultivated bacteria from the original William Morris textile workshops to conceptualise a fully microbial based colour palette to reprint his original textile patterns. Pigment-producing bacteria were applied to block prints and grown on silk and velvet over a span of five days. In a process that provides equal agency to these living organisms, the bacteria multiply, spread, and develop over time to reveal colours and patterns on fabrics. As the designer, Payne initially directs the bacteria placement, but the final patterns are very much dependent on the bacteria itself.

For 10 years, Eternally Yours gathered and disseminated knowledge about ways to extend cultural life time extension of products. As of January 2005 the foundation no longer exist. Proud Plastics is continued by Liesbeth Bonekamp, former chairman of Eternally Yours and partner in MAX.

Proud Plastics Unlike traditional materials like wood, steel and stone, plastics are not perceived as a clear category with predictable properties, but rather as the fuzzy products of New Alchemy, where anything can happen. Consumer experience is characterized by an ambiguous attitude towards plastics. On the one hand the New Alchemy represents amazing and promising new achievements that shape our future. On the other hand Alchemy metaphorically expresses the dark and frightening side of new developments. Designers such as Hella Jongerius and Marcel Wanders have demonstrated that plastics can be treated in an artisan way, like copper or wood. They provided us with new esthetical dimensions of plastics. Applied in unconventional ways they have the potential to contribute to product longevity by showing less vulnerability.

Rotation moulding experiments Proud Plastics initiated an experiment with rotation moulded material. Several types of particles were applied to the basic material in the mould. Not all tests were successful. The best results are shown in this database. The recipe of these results will not be revealed.

Consumer applications: Properties such as; lightweight, high impact, high stiffness and easy processing also make Pure particularly useful for consumer applications. Some specific applications include suitcases, helmets, sports gear and kayaks. Additionally, it is suitable for use in billboards (promoflex) or advertising panels in sport accommodations (Promodur).

Construction industry: Standard Pure panels show very good impact behavior. This enables their use for protective purposes. Pure is easy to transform into thick (>3mm) panels. There are no technical limits towards the thickness of the panels. This also enables customers with sheet pressing facilities to produce Pure panels themselves. Fabrics and panels can be supplied with UV protection. Pure on PU, PVC or honeycomb is also possible.

Other applications: Demonstrating good compatibility with other materials, Pure is an excellent reinforcing material – either as a fabric or a sheet – as it adds local strength and stiffness.

The recycled paper is produced from 100% post consumer waste paper. Post consumer waste paper is paper, cardboard and wood fibre collected for the purpose of re-use after the respective product was used as intended. The caramel-coloured bio-resin is sugar cane resin. It is produced from plant waste occurring during sugar production, called bagasse. After curing, the bio resin has thermosetting features and forms with the natural fibres a hard, mechanically highly resilient composite material with stable dimensions. The large-sized panels have resistant surfaces and homogeneous, closed trimmed edges. The bio composite panel in thicknesses of less than 3 mm can be glued to substrate materials. In larger material thicknesses, i.e. above 5 mm, they are dimensionally very stable and therefore self-supporting.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/recycled-acrylic-greencast-ecocrylic-xt/,Recycled acrylic: Greencast® & Ecocrylic® XT,Plastics,PLA1360,Netherlands,Pyrasied,"Pyrasied leads the way in recycled acrylic in the Netherlands. They offer two brands of recycled acrylic in stock: Green Cast, a 100% recycled cast acrylic available in over 25 colors and a range of different thicknesses, and EcoCrylic XT, a 100% recycled extruded acrylic, stocked in clear, opal, and black.

Acrylic is exceptionally suitable for recycling. It’s one of the purest plastics from a recycling perspective. Unlike many other plastics, acrylic is ideal for both mechanical and chemical recycling. The key advantage is that acrylic avoids downcycling, meaning no secondary product of lower quality is produced. This creates a true closed-loop recycling system. During the recycling process, acrylic can be completely reverted to its basic raw material — from polymer to monomer. From this base, new, perfectly clear or custom-colored acrylic sheets can be produced, maintaining exceptional quality even through repeated recycling.

Pyrasied is a wholesaler, fabricator, and developer of acrylic and sustainable plastics, offering an eco-friendly alternative for every material. The company proudly distributes environmentally conscious brands like Green Cast, EcoCrylic XT, Smile Plastics, Plasticiet, and Durat.","Recycling, Plastics",Variable,100%,Closed,Variable,Hard,Medium,Poor,None,Moderate,Good,Good,Moderate,Medium,Good,No

Woven in Vescom’s 100% CO2-neutral weaving mill and incorporating predominantly recycled polyester FR boucle yarn made from post-consumer PET bottles, yarn-dyed upholstery fabrics Auckland and Foster achieve a three-dimensionality and handcrafted feel that can’t be replicated with flat, untextured yarn.

Foster: incredibly soft touch A unicoloured, universal boucle upholstery fabric with an incredibly soft touch, Foster is remarkably unique for its combination of homelike comfort and extreme high performance. Foster’s universality is reflected in its 27 handcrafted colours inspired by nature’s diversity, from grounding earth and raw minerals to fresh wildflower fields, soothing water and sky, and lush plant life.

Auckland: playful and three-dimensional A tightly woven boucle melange, Auckland gets its playful look, three-dimensionality and organic grid from the intermingling of its two different weft yarns – one boucle, the other flat. The different coloured yarns used in each jacquard upholstery fabric produce 34 unique and surprising colour combinations, like crisp violet and mossy green or bold blue and vibrant orange.

Cohesive combinations Due to their boucle yarn and complementary palettes, Auckland and Foster can be harmoniously combined in interiors and on furniture and wall panels. Their colours work with any kind of atmosphere as well as in combination with other materials.

Qualified for the contract market Specifically developed to satisfy the strict technical demands of the international contract market, Vescom’s recycled boucle upholstery fabrics are durable, light- and colourfast, highly resistant to abrasion, low pilling and easy to use. The products pass all European and American flame retardancy tests, a quality that’s embedded into the yarn itself rather than applied as a finish, guaranteeing it remains permanently contained in the fabric.

To improve the acoustics, mostly the reverberation time will be shortened. The RTS acoustic panels ensure optimum absorption and are easy to process. The total system of the RTS acoustic panel (full-colour) consists of a plate that is installed on a cavity filled with absorption filling. The absorption materials ensure that the disturbing reflection becomes countered, and the reverberation time is regulated, ideal against flutter echoes. 280 bottles are used for the production of 1 sheet.

The RTS acoustic felt panel can be glued with sealant or tacked with brad nails against wall. Easy to saw and cut. To achieve a higher absorption value, the panel is normally mounted on a frame with a maximum line spacing of 600 mm. The RTS acoustic panel increases acoustic comfort, even in busy areas. The panel can be used in almost any environment such as offices, hospitals, educational institutions, public areas, auditoria, care centers, etc. Beside the excellent absorption qualities, the panels have good mechanical strength (impact resistant). No harmful fibres are released while processing the panels. Flame-retardant class B (EN 13501-1). The panels are resistant to rot, fungus and mites. Contains no chemical components, maximum sound absorption, UV resistant. Produced in the Netherlands.

The standard panel is available in 36 uni-colours and 38 colours from the colour card RFNO:1012.1. In addition, RTS-Preidel can provide a basic white panel with any digital image.

four structures, one family Designed to work in unison, the four structures that make up Vescom’s yarn-dyed recycled upholstery family – Wilson, a basic weave; Avon, a melange; Norfolk, a grid; and Harding, a twill – honour fundamental weaving techniques. The non-directionality of some structures makes them incredibly easy to combine with one another – and to integrate into interiors.

Fibras, Moon and Dunas are not only designed with nature in mind, but their structures and colours are inspired by nature.

Moon: from the ground up Boldly expressive and large in scale, Moon includes 13% recycled content and recalls volcanic rocks, baked clay or swathes of stone. This relationship is strengthened by the surfaces’ organically irregular appearance – as if nature itself had crafted them. Alongside matte surfaces in colours like sun-baked sandstone, chalky clay or cool slate, the subtle glow of soft golden or coppery tones calls to mind the reflected light of the moon.

Dunas: organic imprints Featuring 13% recycled content, Dunas evokes the countless traces left by nature’s hand. Its 14 soft colours and visible grain effect allude to anything from carved wooden structures to strands of fresh young straw to the wavelike imprints on a windswept sand dune – a reference heightened by Dunas’s extremely matte appearance.

Fibras: founded on fibres The pressed look of Fibras – which includes 20% recycled content – is a nod to the shredded waste material with which it’s partly made, revealing the feel of its former life. Each of the 15 dominant colours – from dusty neutrals to smoky pink, stony blue and mossy green – comprises countless other colours, offering added depth and three dimensionality while making it easy to combine with different palettes.

Working with recycled materials is just one aspect of Vescom’s conscious approach, which also involves using only water-based inks and phthalate-free vinyl films. Minimising energy and water consumption, the eco-friendly in-house production is 10% carbon neutral, aligning with their commitment to creating products with a low environmental impact.

Vescom Sustainable Materialogy It’s also possible to create synergic sustainable interiors by combining Vescom’s recycled vinyl wallcovering with other Vescom materials that incorporate recycled content, from upholstery to floor-to-ceiling curtains.

The recycled PET filament prints really easy. It’s strong, flexible and almost no warping during printing. Furthermore, it’s a very clean plastic, meaning that it’s food contact acceptable (FCA) and you won’t have any smell during printing.

It is made of waste source drinking bottles, the material is PET. Printing temperature (advised) 220-240 C (428-464 F), platform temperature (advised) 50-70 C (122-158 F), printing speed (advised) 40-70 mm/s, package size 215 x 205 x 65 mm (8.5 x 8.1 x 2.6 inch), package weight 1 kg (2.2 pounds).

3D printing is today’s trendiest industrial revolution. At Refil, they aim to make it a sustainable one as well. Why continue to use new plastics, when there’s so much old plastic we can re-use? At present, most plastic waste is perceived as valueless, it ends up in landﬁlls or incinerators. Only a small fraction of the plastic waste is recycled. Unfortunately, a lot of discarded plastic ends up in our rivers, the sea (so called “plastic soup”), forests and even in animals. Plastic waste is a global problem and is interfering with our food chain and ecosystem. Moreover, plastic is made from oil, and this resource isn’t infinitely available.

It’s time that we take responsibility and we make smarter use of our resources. It’s time to change and start recycling. Refil wants to offer the makers of the world a 3D printer filament that is fully recycled, with a quality that is comparable or exceeds premium non-recycled filaments. That’s why, for the last couple of years, they have been working on fully recycled filaments. After years of extensive testing and fine-tuning, they are proud to introduce fully recycled ABS filament made from car dashboards and PET filament made from old PET bottles.

Refil is founded by Rotterdam based design agency Better Future Factory (BFF), founded by five alumni from the Delft university of technology. BFF is a multi-disciplinary design and engineering company. BFF finds and develops creative yet realistic and sustainable solutions by incorporating the essential principles of the circular economy. They work on pressing issues like the plastic waste problem. They recover, re-use, and recycle as much materials as possible to reduce the pressure on the environment and on companies which face growing resource constraints. BFF works on international challenging projects in collaboration with a broad network of experts, partners and enthusiasts.","Sustainable, Plastics",Glossy,0-50%,Closed,Smooth,Hard,Warm,Moderate,None,Moderate,Good,Good,Good,Light,Moderate,No

Derived entirely from renewable feedstocks, releaf® represents a next-generation sustainable packaging solution with full recyclability. This material distinguishes itself through superior barrier properties compared to conventional plastics, effectively preserving carbonation in beverages and extending the shelf life of food products. As such, releaf® is particularly suitable for use in bottles, films, and textile fibers.

In addition to its functional performance, releaf® offers a range of technical and environmental benefits. Its high mechanical strength allows for the creation of lighter and thinner packaging, thereby reducing material usage and waste. The polymer’s thermal stability and compatibility with existing recycling infrastructures further support its integration into circular systems. Lifecycle analyses indicate that PEF carries a significantly lower carbon footprint than fossil-based plastics, aligning with global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Avantium collaborates with several prominent companies—including Hoogesteger, Amcor, and Albert Heijn—to implement releaf® in commercial applications, bringing sustainable packaging alternatives to the European market.

Positioned as both a material and a mission, releaf® is intended to contribute to the transition away from fossil-based plastics by offering scalable, bio-based alternatives.","Biobased, Other naturals, bottles, packaging, PEF",Glossy,50-100%,Closed,Smooth,Hard,Medium,Good,None,Unknown,Unknown,Moderate,Good,Light,Good,Yes

https://materialdistrict.com/material/root-textile/,Root Textile,Other naturals,ONA996,United Kingdom,Rootfull,"Rootfull Rootfull unites design with biology and reconnects humanity with Nature. It’s a pioneering venture that grows wheatgrass into templates carved from beeswax to create lamps and acoustic wall hangings from root. The textile is grown simply with wheatgrass seed and water to create a material that is woven entirely by Nature.

Each design combines sustainability, innovation, and bio-sculpture to allow the root to weave its own path through templates carved from beeswax. Grass root grows best in colonies and as such the threads gather in groups to form repeating pathways that can be sewn, plucked, and stitched. Rather like a tree growing, the root takes different paths every time, altering the light and shadow of each lamp or wall hanging to create individual pieces.

Over 12 days the shoot grows to 20cm while the root binds below to form a naturally woven structure. With sustainability at the heart of the process, the ingredients are organic and locally sourced. Water is reused from runoff and any leftover shoot or seed is eaten as animal fodder. The pieces show that the power of plants are infinitely renewable, and nature’s amazing capabilities are simply waiting for us to tap into.

This is bio-design in its simplest form. The material becomes lamps and wall hangings that seek to shine a light on a forgotten natural fibre that can be used to grow our built environment. Through contemporary craft, innovation and invention, Rootfull grows root into memorable artefacts that cultivate material intelligence and regenerative design.

Biodesign The Rootfull innovation demonstrates bio-design in its simplest form, incorporating the use of living systems to grow new materials. It uses natural processes to grow organic textiles and even final products. The material is 100% organic and biodegradable. It explores the sensory aesthetic of root and the promising possibility of textile grown from seed. Root could potentially replace many synthetic and harmful alternative fibres. Organic coatings preserve the root structure and rather like a straw hat, it will provide a lifetime of functionality, if kept from the elements.

About the Founder Zena Holloway is a well-known commercial underwater photographer and the founder of Rootfull. It was the tsunami of underwater pollution, human impact and coral bleaching that drove her to look for solutions in bio-design. In 2018 the first seed of an idea was planted and Rootfull has been growing ever since. Curiosity led her to grow artefacts with mycelium first, before discovering the binding properties of root. The ocean and life underwater are her references, so she designs the root into textures and patterns that emulate coral. In doing so, she strives to highlight the devastation of coral reef bleaching caused by global warming. Just as roots underpin the natural world that exists above ground, so too coral is the foundation for the ecosystems of our oceans. Through Rootfull she hopes to inspire a greater awareness of materials and champion ocean conservation.","Acoustic, Biobased, Other naturals, roots, textile",Variable,50-100%,Open,Variable,Soft,Medium,Good,Moderate,Moderate,Moderate,Poor,Poor,Light,,Yes

https://materialdistrict.com/material/rotterdam-fruitleather/,Rotterdam Fruitleather,Other naturals,ONA522,Netherlands,Fruitleather,"Every Tuesday and Saturday Rotterdam enjoys its market. This is the biggest outdoor market in the Netherlands and it also happens to generate the largest amount of fruit and vegetables waste as each day with around 3,500 kilos of rejected fruit and vegetables. Rejected produce includes, for example, an imperfect mango or some squashed nectarines. To dispose of the trash, it costs the stand owner 12 eurocents/kilo. Therefore, some market vendors are tempted to illegally dump their waste in order to cut costs. Out of this problem, the idea for this new kind of material was born.

For a number of months, a multi-disciplinary collective of designers from the Willem de Kooning Academie in Rotterdam collected on a weekly basis the “waste” from the market and developed a particular process for the creation of their brand new material: Original Rotterdam Fruitleather.

For inspiration, the team looked at the different techniques chefs use to create wonderful flavour experiences with fruits and vegetables. One of those techniques is to mash, cook and then dry fruits to make them into a candy like piece of fruit called fruitleather. By producing this on large scale with the unsellable fruits from the market, a new kind of material is created. This material can be used in many different ways, creating many different products. The designers have created so far a handbag made completely out of the fruitleather material for example. The bag shows the quality and possibilities that fruitleather has to offer as a material.

This group of designers wants to create awareness for the problem that is food waste and show that there is an solution. Their goal is to work together with companies and organizations to improve the quality and technical properties of this material and create a wide range of products.

As of 10 November 2017, new photos have been added from the improved material.","Biobased, Ecology, Sense & Sensibility, Sustainable, Other naturals",Matte,0-50%,Closed,Medium,Soft,Warm,Moderate,Strong,Unknown,Unknown,Poor,Poor,Medium,Poor,Yes

Due to the molecular bond, this is sufficient for very durable protection. And that in just one layer.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/rubitherm/,Rubitherm,Metals,MET256,Germany,Rubitherm Technologies GmbH,"Rubitherm Technologies manufactures encased Phase Change Materials (PCMs) with a high energy density for heating, cooling, thermo-sensitive transports, medical/therapeutic applications as well as food storage applictions. Operating like rechargable batteries, these materials use the solid/liquid phase change to store and then release large quantities of energy at constant temperatures.

Phase Change Materials (PCM’s) exploit the material phase change from solid to liquid or vice versa for storage and subsequent use of heat or cold at constant working temperatures. In many ways, PCMs are like rechargeable batteries, but for thermal energy. Because Rubitherm’s PCM materials are bound – or encased – within fibres, grains, powders or panels, they are usable in many every day systems. The many possible applications of Rubitherm PCM’s include improving the temperature retention of food during the time period between food preparation and delivery to the customer. Rubitherm also focuses on the development of its materials for use in building climate control. One of Rubitherm’s flagship projects is the storage tower in the tropical green house in the Botanical Garden Berlin. During the day, solar heat from the roof is stored in a metal CSM panel filled with Rubitherm’s PCM. At night, this heat is released into the greenhouse area, resulting in considerable energy, CO2 and cost savings.

Rubitherm’s patented mechanism ensures that the PCM, when in liquid form does not leak out of the granulate or encasing material. The result is that the bound and encased PCM is always a ‘dry’ solid product, thus eliminating the need for liquid handling. As a result, large quantities of thermal energy can be stored and released at relatively constant temperatures without any volume changes – even when limited volumes and low operating temperature differences are applicable.

Applications of Rubitherm’s bound PCMs are unlimited as the development and modification of PCM material by Rubitherm can be adjusted according to customer requirement.",Metals,Variable,0%,Closed,Smooth,Soft,Warm,Poor,None,Good,Good,Poor,Poor,Light,Good,No

The prevention of rust is an age-old problem in manufacturing. Rust has brought down planes, slowed ships, disabled engines, ruined bridges, spread through reinforced concrete, jammed guns, broken washing machines, and reduced unnumbered bicycles to useless scrap. While constantly cast as a devil, a closer look at rust reveals a variety of startlingly beautiful patterns and complex mixtures of colour.

With this in mind, Yuma Kano Studio believed that the attractive expressions of rust could be produced in quantity and used in new textures and products. They developed a technique that allowed to transfer only the rust from metal plates using acrylic resin. These plates are exposed to light, rain, earth, and seawater to create rust. The rust is then collected, and the plates are exposed to more weathering, which creates another crop to harvest in a process similar to an agricultural cycle.

Unlike metal, the light penetrates rust trapped inside the resin, which creates a frozen moment from a process that has taken years. Because the resulting material can be used like ordinary acrylic resin, it holds limitless possibilities for various products, interior design, and construction.","Sense & Sensibility, Plastics, acrylic, metal, rust",Glossy,50-100%,Closed,Smooth,Hard,Medium,Poor,None,Moderate,Good,Moderate,Good,Medium,Moderate,No

The fish The salmon skins are farmed, not wild catch. Also, the eggs are from aqua culture. The salmon skins are farmed for their fillets, not for the skins. The skins are known as “waste” and normally used is animal feed products. This upcycling helps the cradle-to-cradle story (or from filthy to fashion). The salmon skins are free to use and no CETIS is needed. The salmon skins are from salmons around 3 years old.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/sandwich-plate-system-sps/,Sandwich Plate System SPS,Metals,MET128,United Kingdom,Intelligent Engineering (UK) Ltd,"SPS is a composite material comprising two metal plates separated by an elastomer core, which transfers shear between each plate, eliminates the need for stiffeners and precludes local faceplate buckling. It combines the performance advantages of metal faceplates, a PU core and a composite structure into one material. The thicknesses of the composite elements are tailored to meet the needs of each application. It is an excellent alternative to both stiffened steel and reinforced concrete and delivers high stiffness to weight ratio, simpler fabrication, improved performance and increased safety. It has improved fatigue and corrosion resistance. In SPS structures, the elastomer core dissipates strain energy over a large area, reducing load concentrations that lead to permanent deformations and cracks. It is used in a wide variety of new construction and repair applications in the maritime and civil engineering industries.

Conventional structures have limited capacity to absorb blast energy and are susceptible to early rupture. Stiffeners reduce the size of the plate membrane so reducing latent strain energy. Significant blast energy is transferred from the stiff slab or plate to the supporting structure. Connection details cause early fatigue at only 5% elongation of the steel plates. Panels are susceptible to fragment penetration, which further accelerates panel rupture SPS technology and its elastomer core have been developed to create a metal-elastomer-metal composite that can reach its full plastic capacity in flexure or compression without local buckling of either faceplate.",Metals,Matte,0%,Open,Smooth,Hard,Cool,Moderate,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Light,Good,No

https://materialdistrict.com/material/scratch-me/,Scratch me,Plastics,PLA1281,Netherlands,Nikkie Wester | Concept & Textile Design,"The project ‘Scratch me’ is an innovative textile project that contributes to sustainability in the fashion and textile industry.

For this project, special textiles have been developed which visual appearance and structure can change over time.

The textile fabrics woven for this project exist of multiple layers. Between the outer two visible layers, a second pair of layers are hidden. When the outer layers are damaged, the inner layers which were hidden will appear. With this, the look and feel of the fabric also change, making it richer in user’s history by the intensive use without losing its functionality. Depending on the choice of yarn this textile concept is applicable to both fabrics for interiors, as well as textiles for fashion.

The motivation for this project stems from sustainability. In the old days luxury fashion items, which were made out of expensive fabrics kept on passing from one generation to the other. For example, a wedding dress was both used by mother, daughter and granddaughter. When it got damaged, the fabrics of the dress were repaired either by professionals or by the new users themselves. In this way, the fabrics lived on in a very tangible and personal story via its user’s history.

Today, the textile and fashion industry tends to be geared towards creating fabrics that can be easily discarded after using it for a short period in order to push consumers to buy new products. The project ‘Scratch me’ presents an alternative by emphasizing that the user’s history can enrich the textile, making it more valuable on a personal level: sustainability through social inheritance. The textile fabrics of ‘Scratch me’ invite consumers to create a lifelong bond as these textiles become more beautiful over time.

The first samples of the textile fabrics were made in collaboration with the Textile Museum/textile LAB in Tilburg.","Sense & Sensibility, Plastics, fabric, textile",Variable,0-50%,Open,Medium,Soft,Warm,Good,None,Moderate,Good,Moderate,Moderate,Medium,Moderate,No

It is 100% bio-based and biodegradable, lightweight yet robust, making it suitable as a sustainable alternative material for applications such as lighting, furnishing, wall panels (both decorative and acoustic), packaging and sculptural objects.

The material is grown for 14 days before being released from its mould and allowed to grow further on the previously unexposed faces for 4 days. This creates a uniquely varied surface quality and texture; once dried, the front surface is more leathery, with orange and brown colouration and varied surface texture, while the edges and underside are white and soft like suede.

Softer, more malleable substrates (i.e. fibres, cardboard, paper) increase the likelihood of warping and shrinkage, while sturdier-structured substrates such as wood chips and hemp shiv reduce this.

It is also possible to add pigment to the surface of MBCs, either by painting or staining with dyes. While they are water resistant to an extent (the softer suede like surface is more permeable), they can also be coated to enhance water resistance.

One of the great benefits of creating a material out of mycelium is its ability to grow from ‘waste’ or byproducts, including spent coffee grounds, cardboard, fibres from clothes and many more.

The PU is fitted with a milky saturation that completely closes any micro-pores, making the material completely waterproof. This also stops dirt from getting into the cork, meaning that it is much longer lasting too.

It is produced under compression, using the PU as a glue to bond the material. Besides making the cork material sea-water resistant, it also makes it much stronger. Uses are mainly decking for boats, as it is cheaper and lighter than teak, as well as anti-slip, resilient and impact resistant.

Due to the low-maintenance coating, it can be easily cleaned using a sponge and water. Over time, the material develops a whitish UV patina. This can be left alone as it protects the cork from the elements.

Further advantages of cork include a wide operational range of temperature (-180°C to +120°C).

Possible metal coatings include aluminium, titanium or gold, while the reverse side is a neutral black in colour. The metalised fabric side can optionally have a copper, gold or special design printed on it.

With aperatures ranging from 25-70%, Vision is frequently used in exterior glass curtainwall applications as part of an effective daylighting strategy. If only the exterior surface is coated, the view in from outside is reduced and the fabric is also given outstanding energy-transmission reduction values. The reverse surface (the side facing inwards) of the fabric is black and therefore neutral in color. From inside and from further away than 3 m, the fabric cannot be seen. Furthermore, for indoor applications vision can also be laminated in plastics materials or used to create textile surfaces with a unique look.

The range of six fabrics and metallic coatings including the different combinations featuring double-sided coating produces a diversity of variations. Fabric surfaces coated in metal can be further individualised by means of digital printing with UV resistant inks. The options range from simple wording to extensive motifs. Neither the printed surfaces nor the metallic coating itself is visible from the reverse side. Double-sided coating fabrics can be printed separately on the front and reverse sides, while these markings too are only visible on the printed side of the fabric.

Multiple fabric layers produce unique effects. Each element is truly a one-off since the fabric will never overlay in exactly the same way twice. Different fabric types, fabrics with various metallic coating or the combination of coated and uncoated fabrics leave plenty of room for creativity.

The healing agent contacts a catalyst, triggering polymerization that bonds the crack faces closed.

Polymerization of the healing agent is triggered by contact with the embedded catalyst, bonding the crack faces. The damage-induced triggering mechanism provides site-specific autonomic control of repair. An additional unique feature of the healing concept is the utilization of living polymerization (that is, having un-terminated chain-ends) catalysts, thus enabling multiple healing events.

SMPs are polymeric, smart materials that can return from a deformed state (temporary shape-stable at -10℃ to 50 ℃) to their original, permanent shape induced by an external stimulus or trigger, such as temperature change.

The material can store embossed logo/text shape information in the synthetic, paper-like film, and release these 3D patterns when exposed to heat of ≥65°C for 3 seconds. The material is harmless and has passed the EU ROHS Test.

Features of the Manborui SMP label film are as follows. It is easy to verify and visually impressive. For example, to activate the embossed 3D overt pattern ‘water’ in the SMP film by heating, ‘water’ will disappear while the hidden pattern ‘fire’ will be activated, to be embossed in just seconds. It is also irreversible: one time use means is can be used to verify the authenticity of products, and the activation is irreversible. In addition, it is a high-tech and exclusive material. It is PCT patented, and made from PDA certified material. Production processes are complex.

The SMP film comes in variations: different colours, different operating temperatures and different embossed details are all available. As for the heating, a lighter, some hot water or a hair dryer will be recommended testing methods for the SMP material.

Weight of the SMP film is 200g/m2 ±10%, with a film thickness 0.18mm ±10%. The colour and finish is white or translucent matte and the activation temperature is 65°C or 150°F. This activation is irreversible.

The patented surface technology is comprised of millions of raised, microscopic features arranged in distinct diamond shapes to form a pattern.

Inspired by the microbe-resistant properties of shark denticles and skin, it is purely the pattern that works to inhibit micro organism growth – there is no chemistry, toxicity or biocides eluted from the surface.

Laboratory tests show that the micro-pattern disrupts several critical microbial colonizing processes that are necessary for bacteria to develop into a disease-causing biofilm. In static immersion tests, the patterned surface has shown to be able to reduce bacterial growth by 80 percent versus an untreated surface.

Usage:

Sharklet SafeTouch, hygienic disposable “skins” that are applied to high-touch germ-prone areas in commercial and healthcare settings. Sharklet-patterned urinary catheter to help combat catheter-associated urinary tract infections.

The manufacturer is currently developing products with the Sharklet pattern manufactured directly into the surfaces of outside equipment.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/sharx-braided-sleevings/,Sharx Braided Sleevings,Plastics,PLA997,,A&P Technology,"When we think of braided (i.e. knitted) objects such as socks that shape to forms, we think of braiding materials such as woolen yarns. This material is much the same in concept, except that A&P Technology braid aramid, carbon and fibreglass materials for use as reinforcement in complex composites.

Sharx braided sleevings can easily conform to the shape of products with changing geometries such as prosthetics and hockey sticks, improving overall performance, minimizing weight, and maximizing strength.

A sleeving takes on the exact shape and dimensions of the part over which it is pulled. When the sleeving is pulled over a part with changing cross-sections the fiber orientation, the thickness, and the yield of the braid vary at each point along the length of the part. These variations are predictable and repeatable and lend themselves to easy and precise manufacture of composite parts.

Sharx braid is seamless, so all fibers within the reinforcement work together to carry the load. The fibers in Sharx sleevings orient themselves to follow the load path. For instance, a 2″ diameter sleeving used to manufacture a goalie stick pulls down to 1.1″ over the handle, resulting in a low angle which increases the stiffness. As this same sleeving is pulled over the blade of the goalie stick, the braid diameter increases to 2.3″ resulting in a 54.4 degree angle and increased impact resistance.","High-tech, Lightweight, Process, Plastics",Glossy,50-100%,Open,Medium,Resilient,Warm,Moderate,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Light,Good,No

It is made of vacuum pressure treated Siberian Larch, which is impregnated with a water repellent additive for providing improved dimensional stability and increased protection against the elements. The production method is based on a vacuum pressure treatment. This gives the timber protection from wood decay. At the same time the wood is impregnated with a wax mixture. A preservative with a water repellent additive (TANALITH EXTRA) provides extra protection against moisture and reduces maintenance requirements.

Due to this technology a new dimension is offered with Siberian Larch. Prior to impregnation the timber is often face band sawn. This method now offers opportunities for open and closed cladding in different shapes and dimensions.

The Siberian larch used in the material is a pine wood product often used for cladding. It has a high aesthetic value because of its natural, pale green colour. The WaxedWood material has various colour effects: from natural pale green to warm rich brown to silver grey.

The wood used comes from sustainable managed forests earning the product a FSC or PEFC label. The timber has been comprehensively assessed for LCA also has the Dutch Dubokeur and Komo certificate.

In the second phase, Monaco experimented with combining hydrogen peroxide and bicarbonate of sodium, turning the fibres softer and whiter.

This understanding that we live in a symbiotic relationship with microbes, plays an important role which coordinates the function of our whole body. Therefore, what we wear next to our skin can have a direct impact, as such, our environment shapes our health.

Many textiles in the fashion industry contain toxic chemicals such as heavy metals, antimicrobials, chlorine bleach, and formaldehyde, in every stage of the production process. Not only are these chemicals a serious health risk, but they are also harmful to the environment and natural ecosystems. This has led us to question the clothes we live in, who is living on us, and how this plays a role in our overall health.

SKIN SERIES addresses the unsustainable problem of chemicals in the fashion industry and their effect on both the environment and the body. The textile and treatment add performance and function to clothing using a natural bio-tech approach. The Probiotic Textiles technology encapsulates healthy bacteria into the fibres of clothing. These are activated when they are in contact with the moisture on our skin, allowing them to alter the microbiome of both textile and skin. The encapsulated bacteria reduce body odour, encourage cell renewal, and improve the skin’s immune system.

A razor thin natural stone product, this slimmed down heavyweight is fixed to a cork backing. The result is a lightweight stone tile that is able to bend. An additional advantage is that it can be cut like cork.

The manufacturer explains the company name as a blend of the words ‘cork’ and ‘tile’. The product’s name of Slimstone fits with this theme. The producer’s speciality is the development of a method that allows the very thin slices of slate to be mounted onto a soft, durable cork backing. Through this process, Slimstone becomes the thinnest stone tiles on the market. The manufacturer also takes care of distribution and installation of the material.

The stone sheet comes in a stock of 10 different colours. The slices of slate are from India. Each one is slightly different, giving the tiles individual patterns.

Through experiments with own yarn bindings and special materials, innovative cloth construction have been developed. In this particular combination of binding and material she tries to achieve unexplored surplus values. Her tectonics are clearly geometric. Aleksandra Gaca finds her inspiration in abstractive architectural concepts like rhythm, repetition and also dance and motion.

A number of her refined, more subtle structure are placed in commercial collections of De Ploeg and Kendix International Textiles as curtain fabrics. The overdimensioned designs can be found in the project collection of Hybrids+Fusion. These tougher qualities can be used as upholstery, wall-lining and even carpets.

The Slumber collection, part of Aleksandra Gaca’s latest developments, is a range of very robust 3D weavings in textures, rich of contrast. These warm woollen fabrics have been applied to several products like pillows, beanbags (to sit on) and scarfs. Slumber shows that the 3D effect in her work has become stronger during the time.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/smile-plastics/,Smile Plastics,Plastics,PLA524,Netherlands,Pyrasied,"This beautiful and unique Smile Plastics collection is made from 100% plastic waste such as PET plastic bottles, chopping boards and packaging material. Its sustainable nature cheers everyone up! Each panel is unique and has its own design. The material is water-resistant, fully recyclable and easy to work with. The Smile Plastics range comprises eight types, each available in three kinds of material: high-impact polystyrene (HIPS), PET and high-density polyethylene (HDPE).

Smile Plastics offers stunning designs, a few examples:

Kaleido is a colourful panel made entirely from PET bottles. This material has an extremely good fire rating (B2 according to the European standard EN13501), making it the only plastic that may be used in public spaces, such as airports. Kaleido is hard and rigid and completely moisture- and weatherproof.

Charcoal is made out of PET packaging material and is deep black with white flecks. Charcoal shares the same properties as Kaleido because it is made from the same material. Both types are highly suitable for tabletops and worktops, bar and counter fronts, furniture and splashbacks.

Ocean is the only translucent panel in the classic collection and, like Charcoal, is made out of used packaging materials. Ocean is a beautiful, deep-blue panel with small, coloured speckles; hence its name. Ocean has a wider range of applications because it can also be used in areas such as lighting, translucent partitions and furniture.

Alba is a white, marble-like panel with golden and silver flecks formed by the foil from yoghurt pots. Alba is rigid enough to be used as tabletops, furniture or in structures. The material is moisture-proof and reasonably scratch-resistant. Caution: because HIPS is a flammable material, it must be kept far away from naked flames.

The coloured Orca panels remind many people of a cross-section through cabbage, or of marble. They are made out of chopping boards and packaging materials. This is a food-grade material and therefore safe for use with foodstuffs. Orca panels are highly suitable for tabletops and worktops, bar and counter fronts and furniture.

Heron is a laminated panel in light grey tones with hints of yellow and black. The Heron blend with its unique, aesthetic colour palette will remind you more of the stately bird after which the design is named, than of its actual origins.

The inspiration for Grey Mist came from a walk in the hills of Wales – a rainy, grey world, beautiful in its simplicity. It is a colour that complements virtually anything without fading into the background.

Spectra is an illuminating product in every sense of the word. Made out of PET packaging waste with elements of Kaleido, the colourful energetic fragments of Spectra’s previous life form the core of this design.

Pyrasied stocks all Smile Plastics collections in 12 and 20 mm thicknesses, up to 3000 x 1200 mm sheets. Only full plates are available, but cutting services are offered. Residual waste is included.

The main components are old, unused terracotta tiles from the Soviet era in Lithuania and local soil applied to the latter in a specific way, creating a varying rough texture. Depending on the soil’s location, such qualities as shade and roughness of the tile surface differ bringing a unique character to the tile.

An imbalanced production and distribution of goods in the Soviet Union rendered excessive purchasing habits once the goods appeared available on the market resulting in huge amounts (much more than needed) of goods, in this case tiles, piling up in garages, cellars, and attics of residential houses up to this day, some of them without even having been unpacked. Even back then when these terracotta tiles were manufactured anew (more than 30 years ago), a respective industry statements were issued with a high concern towards the manufacturing-relevant resource such as clay becoming locally scarce, or worse yet, some of the country’s pits had already been entirely depleted of clay. Now, years are passing by those piles of material resource lodging in the corners unattended all the while being discredited by stigmas of the past. This project aims to rewrite the narrative of these tiles by humbly bringing it down to its materialistic essence – earth, by merging it with a simple pinch of soil creating new, modern rustic looks.

Soily invites to seek pure material appreciation that sweeps the bitter memory floor clean just as cleansing one’s palate to welcome a new taste. Soily tile ignites hope for a prolonged life of a well-deserved material and a slowed down extraction of virgin and non- renewable resources.

Wolz Nautic offers a new solution made from solid wood which makes it possible to produce with the same precision as is the case with filigree veneer marquetry. The materials used for manufacturing the decorative elements have proven themselves in nautical applications and are resistant to salt water and UV. The combination of these elements with different raw materials (wood, stone and synthetic) is possible.

Using laser technology in production enables the manufacturer to undertake filigree work right down to the tiniest detail. Implementing slender decorative elements and designs – such as those familiar from interior fixtures – is possible thanks to a high-tech suite of machines.

Each component is provided with an individual code. The ability to exchange individual components is thus guaranteed in the long term. Furthermore, a useful thickness of up to 12 mm means that the decorative surfaces can be refreshed several times over. As a result, sanding down can be performed in one pass with teak deck sanding for example.

Application for these solid wood decorative elements include indoors and outdoors for villas, luxury yachts and other floor surfaces.","Manufacture, Process, Sense & Sensibility, Wood",Satin,0%,Closed,Smooth,Hard,Warm,Poor,None,Poor,Good,Good,Good,Light,Moderate,Yes

On the runway, the model bursts the orb with water inside, which begins to dissolve and melt down her body. Montes’ experiments with water soluble materials and the creation of chemical reactions yielded these innovative fabrics. The dissolvable pattern has been fixated into the fabric using a chemical reaction in the fabric.

Velero Textile by Jef Montes was inspired by the construction of sailboats and the materials from which they are constructed including glass fiber, carbon, aramid, brass, nylon, wool silk, viscose and cotton. Most of the materials were developed in his own studio but also in the textiellab of textielmuseum Tilburg. The silhouettes of Velero Textile draws from the contours of ships. The forms seem to move around the body like a ship in a storm: angular and organic at the same time – inspired by the battle between machine and nature.

It is easy to install without any fixtures or fittings. It can be used in any interior on any type of window, regardless of its size and shape. You can compare the effect of Squid on your window to that of frosted glass or a net curtain. Passers-by can’t glare inside even though you’re still letting lots of natural light in and can enjoy looking out. This is unlike plastic window-covering film, which blocks your natural light and you can’t see through at all.

The material is digitally printable (UV/EcoSolvent/Latex).

Squid reflects a large proportion of heat from the sun before it enters the room. Depending on the colour, 25% to 36% of the sun’s energy is reflected. > Chalk: 36% > Bone: 33% > Oak: 28% > Ash: 25% > Rock: 25%

New is the colour Coal.

Because Squid sticks straight to the glass, the effect of thermal heating is also reduced. This is what happens when the energy from the sun heats up the air between the window and the curtain (or blind) and so also the room. Sticking Squid on your window therefore helps keep heat from the sun out. The material is available in 5 soft natural colours. Width is 130 cm, length is available per cm up to 15 meter. Squid has been developed to also function optimally in humid rooms. This means that the material stays stuck in rooms with a high level of humidity, such as bathrooms and kitchens. Exposing Squid directly to water should however be avoided.

The core values underpinning STADUCO’s offering are stability, durability, ease of installation and customisation.

Stability The rigidity and dimensional stability of the composite material provide high load-bearing capacity and reliable long-term performance. Where necessary, additional support brackets can be installed to accommodate concentrated loads.

Durability Thanks to the composite’s excellent thermal insulation properties, thermal bridging is avoided. STADUCO profiles are impervious to moisture, preventing swelling, rot, or corrosion. They also demonstrate strong resistance to chemical agents.

Ease of Installation and Processing Compared to steel, composite material is 4.3 times lighter in specific weight, making it easier to handle and modify. The high adhesive strength of STADUCO bonding agents allows profiles to adhere immediately to the structural wall, facilitating accurate alignment. No specialised tools are required for the final installation, resulting in a quick and efficient assembly process.

Customisation STADUCO profiles (standard length: 6 metres) can be cut to size upon request. This minimises material waste, contributing to cost efficiency. Each profile is clearly referenced to improve site logistics and enhance productivity.

All profiles feature a 150mm vertical flange to accommodate height differences with the supporting wall without compromising attachment strength.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/starpath/,Starpath,Coatings,COA138,United Kingdom,Nevana Designs,"The aggregate material in Starpath absorbs and stores energy from ambient light (UV rays) during the day, and releases this energy at night, making the particles glow.

The material glows for up to 16 hours after a charge and the particles will last a minimum of 20 years. It charges in daylight but sunlight is better and up to 16 hours.

If an existing Starpath is later required to change to another style of Starpath, such as a different colour, then it would need to be re-sprayed. In order for this to be done the material does not need to be removed.

Therefore Starpath is cost effective to both install and maintain. Its seamless surface may be applied to any existing surface, be it concrete, tarmac, timber or any hard substrate that forms a solid base.

As a resurfacing technique, which does not require the existing surface to be removed, it eliminates the substantial cost of removal and disposal of the existing surface.

If it is pitch black outside, this luminous natural earth is enhanced, while if the sky is lighter, the path won’t release as much luminosity – it adjusts accordingly.

It is certainly a sustainable surface, perfect for cyclists and disabled access. It also has a high safety margin with its anti-slip properties.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/stimulite-honeycomb/,Stimulite Honeycomb,Plastics,PLA065,United States,Supracor,"Supracor honeycomb is a flexible, fusion-bonded honeycomb. This material has very good shock absorption and stability properties. It’s used many of the products you encounter in your daily life – from the cushioning in athletic shoes, the padding in amusement park attractions and mattresses used by hospitals across the U.S. to ease the pain of burn victims and cancer patients. Stimulite is not affected by bodily fluids, funghi or bacteria, and it’s odeur repellent. Supracor’s flexible honeycomb is an engineered material produced from a revolutionary technology of fusion-bonding. It is a derivative of the aerospace industry which relies heavily on the structural integrity and optimum strength to weight advantages of rigid honeycomb composites. However, unlike aerospace honeycomb, Supracor Honeycomb is not bonded with adhesives. Instead, a proprietary, fusion-bonding technique is used to produce Supracor Honeycomb from an extensive variety of thermoplastic materials. Because it is fabricated from thermoplastics and manufactured without adhesives, Supracor is the only aerospace-type honeycomb to have “memory,” the ability to repeatedly return to its original shape. As a flexible and stable structure, Supracor Honeycomb is setting new standards for shock absorption in a wide spectrum of applications—from impact-absorbing components in athletic shoes to bumpers on amusement park rides.

Supracor Honeycomb is fabricated from an extensive range of thermoplastic elastomers (TPE’s). These materials combine the properties of rubber and plastics for extended durability and performance. They are noted for their good tensile, tear and compressive strength, resistance to puncture, and their flexibility at low and high temperatures. Supracor honeycomb is a matrix of elongated hexagons forming a complex pattern of alternating single- and double-walled cells. Each cell has eight interior and eight exterior radii. In bonded or sandwiched panel form, i.e., reinforced with facings, “I-beams” are formed at the point where the cell walls meet the facings. The I-beams reinforce the cell walls providing additional stability to the matrix, while encapsulated air pockets act as a cushion to further absorb energy. Anisotropy: It is the sophisticated architecture of radiated double- and single-walled cells that makes Supracor Honeycomb anisotropic—having three different degrees of resistance or “flex” in its length, width and vertically against the surface. This enables it to absorb energy or impact from different angles.",Plastics,Satin,0-50%,Closed,Smooth,Resilient,Medium,Poor,None,Unknown,Moderate,Good,Good,Light,Good,No

The basic material, the “wooden textile” is taken from the mulberry tree, the cambium. The basis for the ancient craft of tapa-making is the cambium of the paper mulberry tree, a thin layer of fibers between the bark and the wood of the tree. A tapa is a soft and flexible wooden cloth that Tongans use for rituals like weddings and funerals.

Original tapas have a fascinating beauty but lack the practical qualities needed for contemporary use. By stitching the material, it can be used as a flexible textile, such as a blanket or clothing item. This project was professionalized in 2014 under the name of Cambials.

By broadening and expanding the material qualities of spaces, objects and products,Belén creates tangible design for the future.

Featuring knitted fabrics that are made of wool, each textile is distinctive in terms of tactile appeal and performance. Textile designs within Febrik’s collection include Sprinkles, Razzle Dazzle, Uniform Mélange and Triangle.

Designed by Bertjan Pot, a close-up inspection of the multi-layered, knitted textile Sprinkles reveals a kaleidoscopic gathering of coloured dots. Looked upon from a distance, the colours are subdued by a subtle abstraction. The dots appear to alter in colour depending on the perspective of the spectator.

Razzle Dazzle is designed by Sylvain Willenz and is named after the camouflage painting technique that inspired its pattern of intersecting lines. This textile is notable for a bold graphic contrast that has a resemblance to the Dutch polder landscape as seen from the sky. Razzle Dazzle is available in three variations: two-tone contrast, mélange and plain colour – each of which imbues a distinctive effect.

With a smooth appearance and compliant nature, Uniform Mélange is available in a range of refined colour tones. When applied as upholstery, the fabric adapts to fit countless shapes without resistance. Due to the textile’s inherent stretch, seams are reduced to a bare minimum.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/surface-synergy-textile/,Surface Synergy textile,Plastics,PLA1045,Sweden,Johanna Samuelsson,"Woven 3D texture merged with pattern.

Surface Synergy is an innovative woven project by textile designer Johanna Samuelsson. Shrinking is used to transform the flat textile surface into a texturised one. At the same time as the pattern is created in the loom, also the texture is formed. Or rather, there is an interwoven ability for shrinking; this action of transformation is planned at the same time as the rest of the weave. But as long hold in the loom, the fabric is under tension and little shrinking can occur. First after cutting down and steaming, the final result of the shrinking can be seen.

By the technique of digital jacquard weaving, this project explores the synergy between 3D texture and pattern, where they together function both as construction of texture and decoration of surface. Instead of seeing texture and pattern as separated, both of these notions are embedded in the same process of creating the woven textile. This work proposes on-loom effects requiring minimal finishing processes. Woven patterns, such as plaid and houndstooth, are updated by merging with texture. The interrelation between texture and pattern, transformed by shrinking, twists with traditional patterns and weaving: creating expressions that have the ambition to evoke the viewer by surprise.

The result is a textured surface consisting of an array of protrusions above the original surface and a corresponding array of intrusions or cavities in the substrate. A whole series of features from 10’s of microns to millimetres may be formed in a matter of seconds per square centimetre. The process can be used to produce everything from high aspect ratio spikes up to 2mm in height, blades, channels, swirls and burr-free holes in a range of materials.

On average, a Dutch person creates about 150 kilograms of waste per year, excluding recyclable materials such as paper and glass. This waste is incinerated, and afterwards, about 20 per cent of the waste is left in the form of bottom ash. To make the bottom ash suitable to reuse, metals, such as iron, zinc, and copper, are removed. After that, the ash is cleaned, leaving granulate called FORZ, which is used to make the tiles.

Currently, 15 per cent of sand and gravel in the concrete for the tiles is replaced by bottom ash, and the aim is to make that 30 per cent in the future, amounting of about 15 paving tiles per person in amount of waste. Qualitatively, the tiles are the same as normal tiles, and the price is about the same as well. After use, the concrete can be recycled to create new concrete products.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/sustonable/,Sustonable,Plastics,PLA1135,Netherlands,Sustonable,"Sustonable is made of recycled PET post-consumer plastics and natural stone. Post-consumer plastics are plastics that, after being discarded, are picked up, cleaned, and reprocessed at processing facilities, where they are converted into recycled plastics. This process allows the reuse of plastics and converts them into new products, reducing plastic waste in the environment.

Recyclability : using Sustonable material helps reduce plastic waste by recycling 100 PET plastic bottles per m2 fabricated.

No hazardous chemicals are involved in the production.

Minimum VOC : sustainable materials emit few or fewer toxins, such as Volatile Organic Components (VOCs). For example, the total VOCs for Sustonable material is 33 µg/m3. For obtaining the GREENGUARD CERTIFICATION, the maximum amount is 500 µg/m3.

Lowest energy consumption: according to Sustonable results, the APD is on average 67% lower than the traditional materials used for decorative surfaces (engineered quartz, solid surfaces, HPL, ceramics…). Sustonable ADP is 161 Megajoules (MJ), while the median is 537 MJ. In other words, Sustonable is saving more energy while producing the same amount of m2.

Lowest Carbon footprint : The carbon footprint of Sustonable material is 62% lower. The EPD for Sustonable is 11 kg CO2eq. It compares favourably to similar materials, which average 31 kg CO2eq. Hence architects, designers, retailers, distributors concerned about climate change and sustainability could use this material to improve their environmental footprint.

Low water consumption : Sustonable recovers 85% of the water used for production thanks to the water treatment equipment.

Sourced locally : the natural stone and the plastic bottles come from local sources, better for the environment.

One of the most robust surfaces in the market. Impact resistance: it does not break easily.

No chipping or cracking

Lightweight : can be transported easily because it is not heavy (depending on the application, for wall panelling it is ok, for a kitchen front, not that great).

Easy maintenance : very easy to clean.

No yellow shades after the time. Durable material , does not fade or decolourate or yellow.

Endless possibilities for printing: wood, marble type, stone, concrete, watercolour…

Personalised designs : you can have the design you like: your logo, an image…

It has a stone, robust feeling , not plasticky.

The basis of the tiles is a combination of different clays and loam. Mixed in the workshop with quartz sand and fireclay, the mass is then pressed into the tile form and precisely reshaped by hand. Through a silkscreen process the basic material now acquires form. The glaze impresses rhythmical symbols in the tiles.

The ceramic tile is hardened at a temperature of 1000°C within a short time. Through the low temperature firing the material becomes more porous. The glowing tiles are taken one by one from the kiln using a tongs and immediately buried in sawdust. The process of denying the tile oxygen and the ensuing smoke have an intensive effect on the surface that differs every time: the colour changes according to the glaze and the fine hair cracks are blackened.

TaOk enables tiles to become freestanding objects in the game of dimensions. The basic ideas are a rounded square and petal-shaped cut-outs, which are staggered and superimposed in two planes, so as to reveal each other – an effect that is further heightened by different glazes. The thickness of the clay object allows TaOk to be placed free-standing in space – either as a wall cladding or a partition – and plays with light, position and the surroundings.","Sense & Sensibility, Ceramics, tiles",Variable,0-50%,Open,Medium,Hard,Medium,Moderate,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Medium,Moderate,No

Easily overlooked to many, such a problem did not escape designer and researcher Jiwei Zhou, but inspired her to ponder over the logics of materials concerned with environmental sustainability. After research and repeated testing, Zhou created a new and 100% biodegradable material which is synthesised from recycled tea residues and bioadhesives, named tea clay. Tea clay perfectly retains the loose and porous structure of tea leaves, which makes it conducive to the absorption of odours and the release of fragrance. Additionally, wet tea clay has a good plasticity like clay itself, and a wood-like workability as well as durability, when dried and fixed, with a relatively lighter texture and rustic character.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/temal/,Temal,Metals,MET048,Finland,Temal Oy,"Temal Oy is a manufacturer of facade panels in vitreous enamel as well as enamelled sanitary products in the Nordic countries. Established in early 1994, Temal Oy, as a young specialist in enamelling, carries on the Wärtsilä and Hackman traditions which go back to the 1910s.

The panels can stand high temperatures and continual sunshine. The colours of the panels do not fade over the years and their surfaces do not change due to ultraviolet rays. Enamelled facade panels can also be good combined with other facade materials. The modern facade panels are resistant to fluctuating weather conditions, rapid temperature changes, dust, acid rain and dampness. The material stays clean merely with rain water. Another very important criterion for selection is the corrosion- and fire-resistance of the façade panels.

Biological aspects are also taken into account. Due to the nature of enamel, bacteria and mildew harmful to health do not develop on the surface of the Temal façade panel. In cities and other places where people move around a lot, it is important for the surface of the facade panel to be hard and scratch-resistant. Temal facade panels are easily replaceable, and the same colours are still available after many years have passed. The increase in vandalism nowadays also places great demands on the care and maintenance qualities of facade materials. Enamel is easy to keep clean, and thus it can be said to be graffiti’s worst enemy.

The base material of enamelled facade panels is low-carbon steel, and its price changes are small compared to those of stainless or acid-resistant steel. This, of course, makes long term planning and budgeting easier.

Construction The external properties of Temal facade panels meet the demands set for panels by construction engineering standards. These properties include weight, thickness and temperature resistance. Facade panels do not have surfaces that absorb water or dirt. Moisture coming from the inside gets vented out through the structures. Facade panels are friendly to the user, in other words, they are smooth and have no sharp or unfinished edges.

Tenite cellulosic plastics are noted for their balance of properties – toughness, hardness, strength, surface gloss, clarity, chemical resistance, and warmth to the touch. Tenite products are also easily moulded, extruded, or fabricated and available in natural, clear, amber, and black. Tenite is made from 100% renewable softwood materials. The mechanical properties of Tenite cellulosic plastics differ with plasticizer levels. Lower plasticizer content yields a harder surface, higher heat resistance, greater rigidity, higher tensile strength, and better dimensional stability. Higher plasticizer content will increase impact strength. A special feature of the Tenite molded resin is the fact that a fragrance can be incorporated in it. This fragrance can be retained for a longer period of time. This is demomstrated with the mood pebbles, for which Eastman has collaborated with Rotuba.

Clay and metal minerals are both components of stone. As metals corrode, they return to their original natural states, meanwhile ceramics, when fired, sinter and return to stone. Though this composition and decomposition takes several years, they remain in ceaseless motion.

By accelerating and implementing natural geological processes (such as corrosion, oxidation and sintering) in a deliberate manner, these tiles combine metal and clay in various techniques. Allowing the use of discarded metal in the ceramic process and combining metal into ceramics, to use its conductive attribute.

Examples of the research include ceramic tiles utilising discarded oxidised metal that is applied directly on the clay at its wet state. The oxides are then absorbed and change the ceramics colour and texture after firing. using existing waste rather than harvesting and producing new oxides. Another example is ceramic tiles combined with copper integrated into them by using ‘metal clay’ metal powder combined with an organic binder that disintegrates in the firing and leaves a fully sintered metal that can be used for conducting heat or electricity through ceramic bodies.","Sense & Sensibility, Ceramics, clay, metal",Variable,0%,Closed,Variable,Hard,Cool,Moderate,None,Good,Unknown,,Moderate,Medium,,No

Only 20% to 30% of inert excavated soil is recycled, while the rest is sent to landfills. This soil is considered waste even though it can be a resource. The current development plan to extend metro lines in Paris and the suburbs generates even more excavated soil.

This innovative project transforms this excavated soil and demolition waste into glazed ceramic tiles. These excavated materials, such as clay, marl, sand, limestone, as well as demolition debris like bricks, granite, and glass, find a new purpose. Glaze recipes have been formulated by mixing finely ground waste materials in specific proportions. Clay body recipes have been developed using excavated clays and marls. As a result, the ceramic tile and/or the glazing can be made from fieldwork waste, offering a sustainable alternative to regular ceramic tiles. Second hand tiles are also covered with new glazes made from fieldwork materials.

The different types of clay contain various minerals, offering a wide variety of possibilities for colours and textures, which showcase the diverse palette of Paris. The colours represent the origins of the clays. These ceramic tiles are locally sourced and tell a story. They are water-resistant, solid, and can be applied on walls inside and outside. While producing new ceramics requires excavating a lot of natural materials, this project both reduces waste and prevents the excavation of natural materials.

These different types of textile are available in a grey variant (in several acolours), with phosphorescence (glow in the dark) and a translucent variety (yellow or blue).

Dimensions are a machine maximum 70 cm in width with an unlimited length and the textile is available with an open structure and either ordered or more random.

Over time and especially over the last years, chemical anodization has become a popular finish for aluminum building components. The popular finish however has certain drawbacks. The biggest drawback of chemical anodization is colour consistency between different batches. Furthermore the choice of colours is rather limited as well as the possibilities for application on other metal substrates.

The SuprAnodic collection of EUROLACKE is the answer to the demand of super durable, long lasting powder coatings and offer colour versatility. The new collection consists of twenty-two colours with an anodized look with all the benefits of a powder coating in super durable quality.

The colours selected are the perfect mix between future colour trends and today’s demands in the architectural and design segments.

The Collection has been specially developed for aluminium and steel architectural components, such as window frames, façades, cladding and doors.

Freedom in substrate and colour The major advantage of The SuprAnodic Collection is that a wide range of substrates can be treated including aluminium and steel profile extrusions, cladding or sheet panels; creating a uniform ”anodised” look, impossible to obtain via chemical anodisation.

The powder coatings hide the extrusion lines and have the ability to hide imperfections. Maintenance and repair are made easy, because damages can be repaired on site by use of liquid touch-up paints.

The SuprAnodic Collection has a much better colour consistency than traditional chemical anodisation on different materials and between different batches.

Assured Quality The SuprAnodic collection is part of the Alesta® super durable premium range powder coatings. The powder coatings are designed to endure the most severe weather conditions in terms of UV exposure and humidity.

All products have an assured quality specified by the Qualicoat Class 2 and GSB Master quality labels and meet the AAMA 2604 requirements, ensuring the highest level of protection.

It utilises recycled Thermoplastic Elastomers (TPEs) based on natural rubber to create lightweight and shock-absorbent cellular cushions. Using the generative design and Al-driven customisation based on. the driver’s body scan enables mass customisation and significantly reduces fuel consumption. The eco-friendly lattice structures of the cushions degrade in certain conditions, providing superior shock absorption, durability, and protection against injury and damage. With the use of additive manufacturing and generative design, cushions are developed cost-effectively and efficiently, making them accessible to a broader range of individuals and businesses. It is a better alternative to non-renewable foam options and positively impacts the world.","Recycling, Plastics",Variable,0%,Closed,Variable,Soft,Medium,Moderate,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Light,Good,No
https://materialdistrict.com/material/thermobatch/,Thermobatch,Plastics,PLA770,United Kingdom,TMC Hallcrest,"Thermobatch is a thermochromic plastic masterbatch material. That means it is a raw material, which comes in the form of coloured pellets, used for creating interactive plastic products that can change colour reversibly when exposed to a set temperature.

The Thermobatch manufacturing process is based on thermochromic microcapsules which are dispersed in a polymer vehicle. The most common vehicles for mixing with the thermobatch to create colour changing plastic materials are polyolefin and polystyrene, as well as thermoplastic elastomers and thermoplastic polyurethanes. Other vehicles can be considered for carrying the pigments. The Thermobatch material is manufactured by including Chromazone thermochromic microcapsules in either LDPE or EVA polymers through an extrusion process.

Depending on the required effect, the reversible colour change can be set to go either from a darker colour to a lighter colour on heating or from a lighter colour to a darker colour on cooling. An example is the blue sample shown. With a hand used as a heat source, touching the blue coating turns the colour off. Many colour changes are available: purple to pink or green to yellow, etc. In the opposite direction, in which the material changes colour to show a cooling, a fridge or freezer can demonstrate a colour change from yellow to green or pink to purple or white to blue, to indicate when a product or compartment is cold enough.

The user can interact with the colour-changing products. The interaction literally materialises information about temperature and, in set conditions, it more precisely indicates whether a particular product is at the right temperature conditions for use.

Colours available are blue, black, brown, green, magenta, orange, pink, purple, red, turquoise and yellow. These can all clear (i.e. turn blank or white) on heating and all are also available for colour-to-colour combinations such as purple to pink or green to yellow.

TPG can be made in a similar production process to that of PVB and EVA. In addition, as an safety glass like PVB laminated glass, it can adjust light transmittance by colour change dynamically according to the environmental heat and light intensity.

In response to the high temperature and strong solar irradiation in summer, the material can absorb sunlight, darken the colour, reduce the shading coefficient and prevent the heat to come inside. In response to the low outside temperature and weak sunlight irradiation in winter, TPG will present a colourless or light colour state, allowing more solar energy to come inside.

In brief, the glass can adjust the colour, the shading coefficient, in a smart way to provide costumers with a comfortable living condition. TPI is a complexed polymeric interlay which can change the colour driven by light and heat.

The colour of the interlayer can be regulated at a given temperature by controlling the ingredient of the chemicals. TPI with different colors ranging from blue, green, brown and grey can be provided. Aside from these functions, TPI can be used to prepare safe laminated glasses comparable to PVB film.","High-tech, Innovation, Sense & Sensibility, Smart Materials, Glass",Glossy,50-100%,Closed,Smooth,Hard,Cool,Good,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Heavy,Good,No

Vreeberg’s latest development is a fabric covered elastic sheet.

TPEs consist of styrene block copolymers. This is an exceptional basic starting material because a molecule of block copolymers combines the properties of a thermoplastic with those of rubber. This produces a unique type of polymer in which two hard, rigid end-blocks are connected with each other by a flexible, elastic mid-block. TPEs are easy to colour: fluorescent, metallic and pearl effect and glow in the dark are available options.

When resistance against UV and Ozone influence is necessary for the use of this material outdoors, its properties can be adapted. Vreeberg can also offer specific resistance against extreme heat or cold and chemicals on demand. Additionally, by variation in the composition of the compound, a wide variety of medical applications are possible, such as bed covers and materials for blood bags. These TPE’s are particularly well suited for hospital environments as, unlike natural rubber, they do not aggravate latex allergies.

Vreeberg supplies film and sheet in any elastic material. Thicknesses start from 0,1 mm to 4 mm, and widths from 1 to 1200 mm. TPE sheets and films can be easily welded, also to PE or PP material.

Coatings for parts and components used in demanding environments have to fulfill very stringent requirements. High humidity and saline air in combination with intensive UV radiation create a highly corrosive environment. The thermoplastic powder coatings Abcite® and Plascoat® have proven their worth for many years under these conditions. The unique one layer, primer-less coatings fulfill the highest corrosion requirements and can replace up to 6 layers of conventional protective coatings – all in one!

Abcite® and Plascoat® are harmless, free of all bisphenols, VOCs or halogens and offer adhesion to steel, iron and aluminium without primer. Unlike thermosetting powders, thermoplastic powders melt on a pre-heated surface. When the surface cools down, the coating immediately has its durable physical properties, without further processing. The thermoplastic powder coatings can be applied by dipping in a fluidized bed or electrostatic spraying. A wide range of colours is available.

Independently tested to ISO Standards Abcite® and Plascoat® have been independently tested to ISO 12944-6. “Corrosion protection of steel structures by protective paint systems”. The coatings meet the highest specifications of C5-M and Im3.

Wide range of different applications The thermoplastic powder coatings feature more than 25 years of success stories and references in all types of industries and regions. Some stories deserve to be told.

When a new bridge was built in Kortrijk, Belgium, Abcite® was chosen for the protection of the balustrade. In addition to the perfect long-term weathering resistance requested for such a project, the chemical resistance (salts and vehicle exhaust gas) of the coating was an important consideration when selecting Abcite®. After a sand blasting as surface preparation, the welded grilles of the bridges were sprayed with Abcite® in NCS 7500 N, a specific colour chosen by the architect. In 2020 the bridge is still fully protected and maintenance free.

The high cost of maintaining and operating offshore production facilities is felt no more keenly than in the North Sea. Structures face a constant challenge from corrosion and abrasion. Metal becomes degraded, losing its strength and this can eventually lead to premature, sometimes sudden, failure. In 2010 some of the railing structure have been coated with Plascoat PPA 571 whilst another part with other technology. The railing coated in liquid paint has clearly cracked and flaked and is allowing corrosion of the metal beneath. The railing coated in Plascoat® shows excellent abrasion resistance and does not chip or crack. There is no chance of penetration by water, gases or microbes and so degradation does not start underneath the surface as it so often does with liquid paint.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/thermowood/,Thermowood,Wood,WOO062,Netherlands,Metsä Wood Holland B.V.,"The process that converts premium Scandinavian softwood to Finnforest Thermowood is simple: each piece is steam heated in a kiln. The heat goes to the core of the wood, driving out moisture and resin. The result is a timber with a reduced moisture content and enhanced physical properties: – Thermowood is 50% more stable than untreated softwood. – It suffers less shrinkage, swelling, and distortion in response to atmospheric changes. – It is easy to work with and lightweight.

Thermowood does not need to be treated with preservatives. Thermowood’s superior resistance to water and to attack from fungi means that it will last as long – if not longer – than chemically-treated softwood. For best performance, Thermowood should be installed above ground conditions. Treating this timber with natural pigmented wood oils maintains the rich depth of colour of Thermowood, all year round.

The rich colour of Finnforest Thermowood cladding and decking is similar to western red cedar but is at the same time a warm and reassuring Scandinavian softwood from sustainable forests. Thermowood can be used in many areas such as interior and exterior cladding, floors and indoor ceilings, moldings and sections, facades, garden furniture, playground equipment, noise screening, sauna panelling, fences and terraces.","Biobased, Wood",Matte,0%,Open,Smooth,Hard,Warm,Poor,Moderate,Unknown,Good,Good,Moderate,Medium,Moderate,Yes

It reclaims these components and fashions them into a material that recreates the aesthetic of traditional terrazzo, with a rich grain and hand-of-the-maker quality. Both pleasingly modern and classically styled, terrazzo can be found everywhere – from restaurant entryways in Belgravia to flooring in the London Underground. Random and organic, manufactured yet identifiably human, Foresso builds upon this tradition.

Conor Taylor has invented a new way to repurpose British timber for an original take on traditional terrazzo. Taylor was inspired by seeing extremely high quality wood regularly wasted in enormous quantities during processing. Delicate curls of planed wood and pieces of beautiful timber would, due to their unusual size or shape, regularly be pulped for filler or burned.

Throughout this process, Conor tackled the technical hurdles of imbuing timber with the qualities of marble: crafting wood chips with a stone-like feel, making the surface consistent and durable, and optimising the proportion between timber and resin-binder material; all ultimately ensuring that Foresso could be produced efficiently and at a large scale. To complement its quality craftsmanship, Foresso only uses FSC-certified timber and always sources locally. After refining the process and recipe, Conor switched his attention to design – carefully selecting binder colours and timber compositions to reference terrazzo’s classic aesthetics. As part of this process, Conor began work on developing Foresso’s collections – each recalling an experience of London’s many distinct locales.","Biobased, Ecology, Sustainable, Wood",Matte,0%,Closed,Smooth,Hard,Warm,Moderate,None,Moderate,Moderate,Poor,Good,Medium,Moderate,Yes

https://materialdistrict.com/material/tire-veneer/,Tire Veneer,Plastics,PLA071,United States,Yemm & Hart Green Materials,"Tire Veneer is the name of recycled rubber veneer made from tires. Since tires wear out relatively fast, recycling tires began some time ago as re-treading, which is the retention of the tire interior and application of new tread to the exterior. In the retreading process, the old tread is removed by grinding and the resulting dust is termed “buffings”. These buffings are non-laminated polymerically bound black SBR rubber. To give more aesthetic appeal to the material, colorful virgin EPDM rubber granules are added along with a urethane binder.

The homogenized mixture is approximately 80% black rubber and 20% coloured rubber although this percentage can be varied. The percentage of black rubber indicates the post-consumer content. Heat and pressure convert the mixture into either a block 37” square by 6” thick or a cylinder approximately 48” in dia. by 49” long. A knife slices the block into sheets in thicknesses such as, frac14;. The sheets are then die cut to exactly 18” or 36” square and become tiles. The cylinder is peeled like a veneer log. A knife slices material from the cylinder to produce sheets that can be up to 80’ long.

Tire Veneer is easy to clean and maintain. The material will resist stains, chemicals, weather, impact and punctures. It is also non-corrosive. The non-skid, resilient surface reduces noise. Tire Veneer is often used as a resilient interior and exterior environmentally responsible flooring material. It is also used for a variety of other applications such as consumer products, vibration dampeners and furniture surfaces. Tire Veneer has exterior applications such as sports & recreation, animal housing, truck beds and any high traffic area.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/titanwood/,Titanwood,Wood,WOO022,Netherlands,SHR Hout Research,"Modification of wood by altering its chemical structure is a way of improving its properties. In Europe research and development in this field has become increasingly important. A primary focus of research is to improve the biological durability of wood but also other properties are very important. These include hardness, hydrophobicity, strength, colour, and fire retardancy. With wood modification it is increasingly possible to tailor wood properties for a wide range of end products. Examples of wood modification are acetylated wood, making the wood UV resistant or lumen filling with a substance, usually a resin. These treatments might increase strength properties and slow down the process of water (vapour) uptake, but they do not change the sorption behaviour of the wood over a longer period of time. Bulking to fill the cavities in the cell wall as well as the cell lumen tend to reduce the swelling and shrinkage of the wood might even have a beneficial effect on the long-term sorption behaviour. Modifying treatments are usually the most effective. The chemical structures of cell wall components (lignin, cellulose and hemi-cellulose) are altered and covalent bonds are formed. Modification (in a stricter sense) can be divided into heat treatments, chemical modification and enzymatic treatments. Many properties can be improved permanently, in particular durability, dimensional stability and reduced equilibrium moisture content. The chemistry involved is not particularly complicated. However, the process technology for modification of solid wood is quite sophisticated. It is of paramount importance to combine the right chemicals with the optimum process conditions, at the correct place in the wood structure at the right time. In comparison, the modification of fibre materials is less complex.",Wood,Matte,0%,Open,Smooth,Hard,Warm,Poor,Moderate,Unknown,Good,Good,Good,Medium,Good,Yes

Made from post-consumer coconut waste, these panels offer a 3D effect along with a distinctive natural shape and structure with a warm and cozy exotic look and feel.

To make this material, coconut shells are cut into perfectly measured square pieces, washed with abrasive stones and glued together into larger panels in a tile format (420 mm x 420 mm). The curved texture is made possible by taking pieces of the inside of the coconut shell.

The Tongkonan is available in natural, patina white maroon and gold. The first variant is without further finishing and has a matte, natural greyish look. The patina is painted white and then sanded so that the original natural color is visible. Only water-based lacquers, adhesives and paints are used in the production.

Tongkonan coco tiles can be mounted to a range of flat and curved surfaces like walls, ceilings or furniture. Because of their structure and material composition, it is also important to note that these panels may not be suitable for every application. They are best applied in dry ventilated or humid indoor areas with small temperature fluctuations (less than 12 ⁰C)

It is not for nothing that we find intact layers of linseed oil paints that are hundreds of years old in monumental work. Because monuments and linseed oil paint belong together. RIGO Verffabriek presents TOPLIN linseed oil stand paint. With now also a fully in-house developed water-based linseed oil stand paint for indoor use.

Innovation and modernization Until recently, it was not possible to process linseed oil paint indoors due to legislation. But anyone who is going to start a restoration job on a monumental building will frown at the thought that acrylic dispersions have to be used. These modern synthetic technologies do not match with such authentic surfaces.

In order to offer a solution for this, RIGO Verffabriek has spent the past few years intensively developing water-based linseed oil stand paint. The laboratory conducted research into natural raw materials that could emulsify water and linseed oil, provide sufficient hand grease resistance and yield fine processing. The result is an authentic water-based linseed oil paint system that fully complies with the health and safety law with technically advanced properties. With linseed oil as a base, the product shows respect for monumental surfaces and also consists of 95% natural raw materials. TOPLIN Aqua products meet the requirements of the EU eco-label and are the first paint product to have the highest A+ label of the Swiss Umwelt Certificate.

“The universally usable flax” “Linum usitatissimum” is the Latin name for flax, literally translated as “the universally useful flax”. Flax owes this name to the versatile use of this cultivated crop. It is also nice that linseed oil is used almost completely in the form as it is extracted. Without having to convert it into a new synthetic substance through radical processes. The flax from which the linseed is extracted makes no special demands and grows well in our latitude. RIGO Verffabriek grows flax on vacant lots in the Haarlemmermeer and thus provides for a significant part of its own linseed oil needs.","Biobased, Coatings, paint",Glossy,0%,Closed,Smooth,Hard,Medium,Poor,Moderate,Unknown,Good,Good,Moderate,Medium,Moderate,Yes

It focuses on utilizing both native and traditional materials in new, sustainable ways:

Why This Matters to Parmeet For Parmeet, utilizing every part of a material—whether from oak trees, grapevines, or agricultural by-products—is a way to honour the Earth’s resources. This project is driven by her commitment to:

This project symbolizes a commitment to ecological restoration, encouraging the world to rethink how natural resources can serve multiple purposes while supporting biodiversity and combating climate challenges.

Parmeet strongly believes that utilizing natural by-products such as grape leaves, walnut husks, and oak galls not only honours the Earth’s resources but also contributes to healing it. Protecting and repurposing these materials prevents waste, enhances soil health, and nurtures biodiversity. This circular design philosophy aligns with combating the climate crisis by reducing the dependency on synthetic materials and fostering harmony between human activity and nature.

She sees the preservation of such practices as a vital step toward building a more regenerative and sustainable future, where materials serve multiple purposes and contribute to both beauty and ecological restoration. For Parmeet, these efforts symbolize a commitment to preserving the planet for future generations, while celebrating the cultural richness of both India and France.

Why Using Grape Leaves Matters Grape leaves, often considered an agricultural by-product, are abundantly available in the Cognac region due to its extensive viticulture. Repurposing grape leaves for dyeing creates a circular design process that reduces waste and highlights the region’s rich heritage. In addition, grape leaves offer unique and vibrant colors, such as bright sunny yellows from Ugni Blanc and surprising greens from Merlot leaves.

Once harvested, it can be turned into wood chips, and then into cellulose fibre by ways of extracting a brownish substance called lignin. Cellulose and lignin are the two most abundant organic polymers on earth. While one is used excessively in a host of different industries such as the paper and textile industry, the other stays largely unexplored, remaining an underutilized by-product. In fact, to date lignin is mostly burned in thermal waste plants for the production of energy, with all the consequential negative emissions. Called Tree of Culture, Basse Stittgen’s project traces the journey that those two polymers take, back to the moment when the cellulose fibre was held together by the lignin in a tree.

In Europe’s agroforestry, Picea Abies, or European Spruce, is one of the most cultivated trees, often grown in large monocultures for its pulp, timber and resin. Complex industrial production uprooted the connection between plants as suppliers for products and the consumer. It is difficult to hold a piece of paper and see a tree. The objects made in this project are meant to evoke mindfulness and a connection to the source of their material, when held they can hopefully remind you of a tree, the rough texture of the bark, the year rings that keep track of the seasons and the landscape in which the tree grew. The Tree of Culture is a design-research project exploring, through storytelling and by means of tangible physicalities, the immense potential offered by lignin when reconnected with cellulose, through processes of recombination and rematerialisation of residual matters.

At the center of the physical material research stands the ambition to find multiple ways to reconnect lignin with cellulose and link them conceptually to the processing of the two polymers across scales while imagining possible futures of regenerative transformation. Currently, those reconnections manifest themselves in three different materialities:","Biobased, Curious, Other naturals",Variable,0%,Closed,Variable,Hard,Medium,Moderate,None,Moderate,Moderate,Moderate,Good,Medium,Moderate,Yes

Despite containing no plastic, Treeplast is injection mouldable and can be processed to create objects with no shape restrictions. Skin-friendly, non-electrostatic, lightweight and available in a number of colours, Treeplast also possesses shock absorption properties similar to that of A.B.S.

Treeplast is composed of wood chips (Cellulose 30-50%), lignite, crushed corn (starch) and natural resins. With a density of 1.4 kg/m3, Treeplast has many of the same properties as medium density fiberboard (MDF) as well as the look and feel of wood. Treeplast can also be finished like wood and lacquered for outdoor use. Left untreated, Treeplast biodegrades in water within hours and within 4-6 weeks when left outside in sand or grass.

Treeplast products can be created in standard injection moulding machines with in either new or adapted moulds. In some instances, existing moulds can be used, thus offering an interesting bio-based alternative to many plastic products. However, although Treeplast is shrink-free, it requires processing at a lower temperature than plastic and takes twice as long to cool in the mould.

Applications for Treeplast are unlimited.

Thanks to their non-fraying material, they offer endless design possibilities.

Beyond aesthetics, tretford carpets contribute to a healthier indoor environment, making them ideal for both living and working spaces. This beneficial effect is due to their primary component—the exquisite top hair of the Cashmere goat, renowned for its hygroscopic properties. Unlike most materials, it can absorb moisture from the air and release it as needed, helping to regulate indoor humidity. Additionally, the scaly structure of goat hair binds fine dust particles, significantly reducing airborne dust levels compared to smooth flooring—an advantage for allergy sufferers.

Alongside providing underfoot warmth, tretford carpets are also dirt-repellent, sound-absorbing, and exceptionally durable, ensuring long-lasting quality and comfort.","Biobased, Other naturals, carpet, cashmere, flooring",Matte,0%,Closed,Medium,Resilient,Warm,Good,None,Good,Good,Moderate,Moderate,Medium,Moderate,Yes

It is essential to address the issue of ressource scarcity with new, sustainable concepts. “TRI – the material that touches you” deals with exactly these topics very intensively and innovatively. The previously largely unused but widely available ressource of tree bark with its many positive qualities was combined with a natural binder as part of a long-developed material study. The result is a very stable, strong and at the same time light material with a unique grain and a soft, hand-flattering feel.

A major advantage of the material is its high scalability – from small doorknobs or artworks to stools to large wall/floor coverings, almost any shape and proportion can be produced using various 3D printing techniques and pressing processes. Depending on the type of tree, a wide variety of grains and colors is possible. Sawing, drilling, sanding? TRI can be processed and finished in a similar way to wood and thus allows great scope in surface design.

It is not enough to develop new materials and use them to design innovative products. We have to face our (environmental) problems holistically and fully understand the issues in order to be able to guarantee a lasting positive effect. In addition to the use of renewable, existing raw materials, this also includes the long-lasting design language and uniqueness of the material in order to inspire as many people as possible and, in the best case, to rethink their own actions.

With rounded edges along their length, Tribar’s triangular steel products have a distinctive character and offer a noticeable ‘soft touch’ in comparison with other metal mesh and grid products. These three-sided bars are welded to points on their cross-connections, resulting in lattice-like panels that have a relatively large surface area while maintaining a high degree of transparency. Tribar grids and mesh panels can be galvanized and/or powder coated and can offer a smooth or non-slip finish. Each finish has its own distinctive look.

Tribar sheds new light on the use and application of metal grids and mesh while maintaining the traditional properties that such metal products are associated with. These Tribar products have many applications. They are especially suitable for use on stair treads, for partitioning, as a wall covering or façade, or as a base material for freestanding volumes. Tribar meshes and grids fulfill their function by permitting, filtering or blocking light as required as well as isolating noise. Additionally, Tribar can act as a feature visual element within a designed architectural space.

When installed adjacent to each other, Tribar panels give the visual effect of endless lines. This special characteristic is best demonstrated with the use of specially developed internal and external corners. In this way, the effect of endless lines can be created throughout an entire space. For stair treads, Tribar offers grated stair panels that lend a user-friendly character to relatively large surface areas. An additional practical advantage of this application is maximum dirt permeability. This is achieved through the use of triangular corners and a relatively large opening on the underside.

The Tribar basic range consists of several steel versions – flat or profiled – with 10, 12 or 15 mm bar widths. These triangular steels can be applied in grids or meshes with an individual bar spacing of choice. And depending upon the wishes of the user, the above standard bar widths can be adjusted. The cross-connections of the Tribar panels can be manufactured as strips or as round bars. When Tribar panels are used as treads, they are equipped with so-called ‘bridges’. These reinforcements on the lower side of the panels ensure that the tread does not sag. The height of this construction is adapted depending upon the length dimension of the panel. Specifications for this application can be provided on request.

Tribar products have an industrial and robust appearance, while not losing their attractive visual character. By varying bar spacing – or doubling-up the number of bars – numerous possibilities are created.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/tricoya/,Tricoya,Wood,WOO332,,Medite Smartply,"Medite Tricoya Extreme is a completely new, high performance, wood based panel product. It demonstrates durability and dimensional stability in the most extreme and challenging environments – exterior as well as interior, wet and high moisture, applications.

The product uses proprietary acetylated wood technology and a modified fibreboard manufacturing process to create a wood panel with durability and stability.

Medite Tricoya Extreme has been jointly developed between Medite Europe and Tricoya Technologies and is made using a patented acetylation technology. Medite Tricoya Extreme was developed by challenging the most fundamental reason for wood swelling: water absorption onto hygroscopic wood fibres due to the presence of hydroxyl groups. The hydroxyl groups (water loving sites) can bind or release water molecules causing wood to swell or shrink. It is also believed that the digestion of wood by enzymes initiates at the free hydroxyl sites – which is one of the principal reasons that wood is prone to decay.

Accsys’ proprietary technology used to produce Tricoya wood elements is based on wood acetylation, a process that has been studied by scientists around the world for more than 80 year. Acetylation effectively changes the free hydroxyls (represented as OH in the chemical formula below) within the wood into acetyl groups. This is done by reacting the wood with acetic anhydride, which comes from acetic acid (known as vinegar when in its dilute form). When the free hydroxyl group is transformed to an acetyl group, the ability of the wood to absorb water is greatly reduced, rendering the wood more dimensionally stable and, because it is no longer digestible, extremely durable.

Acetyl groups are naturally present in all wood species. The acetylation process therefore adds nothing to the wood that does not already naturally occur within it, resulting in an end product with no added environmental toxins. The effect of altering the wood’s chemical structure is to create a new product that is modified right through the cross section. By contrast, other wood preservative treatments merely insert chemicals (such as oils, ammonia or metal compounds) into the wood, improving durability but not dimensional stability.","Biobased, Lightweight, Sustainable, Wood",Matte,0%,Closed,Smooth,Hard,Warm,Moderate,Moderate,Good,Good,Good,Good,Light,Good,Yes

https://materialdistrict.com/material/vanceva/,Vanceva,Glass,GLA038,Belgium,Vanceva (Solutia Europe),"Colour and design are being used to create appealing and attractive spaces all round the world, from the eye-catching chartreuse glass enclosure of the Henry Hudson Hotel in New York to the brightly coloured glass blocks in the library and media centre in Peckham, an English suburb in southeast London. As the use of glazing in buildings continues to increase, architects, designers, and building owners are increasingly looking for glazing products to enhance the beauty, originality and quality of their projects. Laminated glass contains a tough, resilient PVB (polyvinyl butyral) interlayer, sandwiched between two or more panes of glass and permanently bonded using heat and pressure. The resulting laminated glass provides unmatched aesthetic, acoustic and structural benefits, increased security and enhanced safety. Up to four interlayers of coloured plastic, selected from a range of nine different colours, can be used to produce laminated glazing in any one of more than 600 transparent and translucent colours, ranging from bright, bold and vibrant to soft pastel, allowing colours to be customised to suit any taste. Unlike other methods of colouring glass, the interlayers used in laminated systems contain heat and light-stable pigments, rather than dyes, so producing colours that are truer and longer-lasting. Laminated glass systems help to block the greater part of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation, protecting the building’s interior and furnishings from fading and deterioration. Vanceva interlayers are permanently laminated between two pieces of glass to form a durable and easily maintained glazing system. The Vanceva Design custom colour interlayer system is based on hues of red, yellow, blue, black and white, and can produce a wider range of colours and moods than can be achieved using stock selections of glass. Vanceva Design interlayers can be combined to produce over 1,000 colour options, transparent, translucent or opaque, so allowing the creation of the perfect tone and intensity. Vanceva Design is proven for use in curtain walls, atriums, skylights, partitions and conference rooms. The combination of Vanceva Design colour interlayers and tinted or reflective glass provides a virtually endless range of design possibilities. Vanceva Design offers a full range of colours, ranging from neutral, soothing pale whites and browns to vibrant, stunning bright purples and oranges. Translucent colours If a frosted look is required to suit a particular design or provide privacy, a translucent colour can be created by adding one of the Vanceva Design white interlayers to the colour mix.

Opaque colours Vanceva Design Pure White is an opaque white that can be added to any other colour selection to make that colour opaque. Pure White can be combined with any colour or Vanceva Design pattern, and also gives side of the glass a completely different appearance.

Metallic designs Advanced Solar Protection Vanceva Design is available in three textures, honeycomb, sandstone and linen, and can be used to complement any of the other available colour and pattern options. Each design gives a unique metallic appearance with unmatched texture and depth. These metallic designs are printed to give a silvery finish that not only provides a sophisticated appearance but also reduces the transmission of solar radiation by reflecting light and heat. Being laminated between two pieces of glass, Vanceva Design interlayers are impossible to scratch.

Fade-resistant Vanceva Design interlayers contain heat- and light-stable pigments rather than dyes to produce fade-resistant colours which retain their colourfast properties and structural stability even in the most rigorous test conditions. The colours are layered between two pieces of glass and so are easy to maintain and clean. Vanceva Design interlayers are available worldwide and replacement glass is easy to obtain.

Specifying Vanceva Design, Vanceva Design Formulation Codes The Vanceva Design formulation code is a number identifying a particular colour.

First, an image template is scanned and converted into 256 grey scales.

This creates an image on the sheet material when viewed from a distance. But when standing next to the sheet material it’s ’just’ a structure. This way an image can be interpreted in a variety of ways. A Vectogramm creates a 2d surface structure, the relief of which varies from fine to grainy, depending on the resolution of the image used. The principle areas in which Vectogramms can be used are architecture, marketing, graphics and art. Due to their durability and the fact that they can be reproduced, Vectogramms can be used for facade design on all kinds of buildings as well as creative elements for noise barriers.

Experiments with water soluble materials and the creation of chemical reactions yielded further to the creation of these innovative fabrics.

Velero Textile was created in collaboration with artists and product designers. Montes abstracted the work of artist Simone Albers into graphic colour patches, which are incorporated into a fabric that has been developed in collaboration with the Textile Lab of the Textile Museum in Tilburg.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/vesta-kuqua-tiles/,VeSta & KuQua tiles,Ceramics,CER241,Austria,KARAK Tiles,"These handcrafted tiles feature geometrical ornaments, which are the result of repeating digitally developed graphic patterns and are fired using an ancient Japanese firing technique. The basis of the tiles is a combination of different clays and loam. Mixed in the workshop with quartz sand and fireclay, the mass is then pressed into the tile form and precisely reshaped by hand. Through a silkscreen process the basic material now acquires form. The glaze impresses rhythmical symbols in the tiles.

The ceramic tile is hardened at a temperature of 1000°C within a short time. Through the low temperature firing the material becomes more porous. The glowing tiles are taken one by one from the kiln using a tongs and immediately buried in sawdust. The process of denying the tile oxygen and the ensuing smoke have an intensive effect on the surface that differs every time: the colour changes according to the glaze and the fine hair cracks are blackened.

Together with the architects Loeliger Strub the VeSta tile with generous floral pattern was produced in a year-long process for a high-rise residential building in Zurich. The simple yet complex principle of VeSta was then handed over to the owners of the 16 apartments as part of a set that included 4 glaze colours and a floor plan which enabled them to work out for themselves how they wanted the tiles to be laid. The system and the elements of the graphic texture can be combined differently to create constantly new forms: ellipses become visible in VeSta, crosses and invisible axes connect the tiles to form large flowers.

The four-part series of the pattern KuQua is based on blending a sphere with a square. The different variations play with the possibilities of these apparently opposed geometric forms and produce floral ornaments.","Sense & Sensibility, Ceramics, tiles",Variable,0%,Closed,Medium,Hard,Medium,Poor,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Medium,Moderate,No

This process ensures that the cell structure of the wood changes and the durability significantly improves. This also makes it more shape-retaining. A major advantage of this method of sustainability is that it does not require environmentally harmful resources. The wood is also thoroughly preserved. This means that processing has no negative effect on the durability of the wood.​​​​​

Plus, their team offers second-to-none service – even after the products have reached your hands.

wise choice

Vescom’s vinyl wallcovering is a sound investment. Given its life expectancy of ten to 15 years, the remarkably strong and durable material is more affordable than alternatives such as glass fibre or paint. To achieve such a long service life, Vescom applies cotton backing to a high-quality vinyl finish, whose colour is integrally spread throughout the product.","Sense & Sensibility, Plastics, vinyl, wallcovering, wallpaper, walls",Variable,0%,Closed,Variable,Resilient,Medium,Poor,None,Good,Good,Moderate,Good,Medium,Moderate,No
https://materialdistrict.com/material/vip-vacuum-insulated-panel/,VIP (Vacuum Insulated Panel),Plastics,PLA988,Netherlands,Bluedec,"Vacuum insulation panels (or VIPs) have one of the highest insulation values possible. With a thickness of only 20 mm, a R value of 4.76 m2K / W can be achieved. That is roughly five times as strong as insulating PIR and about eight times as strong as mineral wool insulation.

Vacuum insulation panels have long been used in the construction in the Alps, but also in Sweden and England. For the insulating effect, fumed silica, or rather a micro-fiber-based silica, is used. These extremely low heat circulating fibers are compressed, after which a barrier film wrapped around it; a very damp-proof foil. Thereafter, the whole vacuum is sealed. This results in panels with a lambda value of 0.0042 W / mK.

This super insulating material can be applied to floors, walls and roofs. With EPS or other sheet materials, it can be formed into panels. It can also serve as cavity wall insulation, as well as used outside in combination with stucco systems.

The panels have standard dimensions; adapters are custom made. Therefore, there is no waste.

While VIP panels are typically more expensive to purchase in comparison with traditional insulation materials, they provide a solution where achieved the required thermal performance is a challenge.","Lightweight, Sustainable, Plastics, insulation",Matte,0%,Closed,Medium,Hard,Warm,Poor,None,Good,Moderate,Poor,Poor,Light,Poor,No

The spruce that is used for Vuré Noir facade cladding is Northern European spruce. The thermal modification produces a very durable wood in durability class 2. This makes it suitable for outdoor applications such as facade cladding.

​​​​​​​Vuré Noir facade cladding has a beautiful warm brown colour due to the treatment method. It gives extra appearance due to the knots and the flame pattern that characterizes Vuren. From an aesthetic point of view, the facade cladding is often sawn or brushed on the visible side.​​​

The origin of Vuré Noir facade cladding Spruce is naturally not very durable. In general, it is more often used for indoor applications. The thermal modification process that is used at Vuré Noir ensures that the wood is heated to a temperature of 210 degrees in an oxygen-poor room. This changes the composition and structure of the wood. This in turn ensures that a considerably more durable wood is created after this process. After treatment, the spruce has durability class 2. This means that it can be used untreated outdoors. In addition to being more durable, the wood is also considerably lighter and more dimensionally stable.

Vuré Noir cladding PEFC certified The spruce wood that Houthandel van Dam use for Vuré Noir facade cladding comes from Northern European forests that are PEFC certified.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/wavethru/,WAVETHRU,Glass,GLA302,Belgium,AGC Glass Europe,"WAVETHRU is a high-performance material innovation designed to mitigate the radio signal attenuation caused by thermally insulated glazing. As building envelopes increasingly rely on coated double-glazing to meet energy efficiency and insulation standards, these materials often act as barriers to mobile signal penetration. WAVETHRU addresses this issue with a retrofittable solution applied directly to the glass surface, restoring and enhancing mobile signal transmission without compromising the functional or aesthetic properties of the glazing.

The material itself is a transparent, conductive coating that is carefully engineered to allow radio frequencies to pass through treated glass areas. When applied to coated double glazing, it reduces signal loss dramatically—from approximately -30 dB to just -3 dB—while preserving essential optical and thermal performance. Light transmission remains at 72%, and the solar factor is maintained at 38%, ensuring that the building’s energy efficiency and visual clarity are unaffected.

WAVETHRU is non-invasive and applied in situ, eliminating the need for structural modifications, wiring, or powered components. The treatment is virtually invisible to occupants and does not alter the appearance, transparency, or insulation value of the original glass. It is also highly customisable, allowing flexibility in design depending on the needs of each project—this includes the ability to specify the percentage of windows treated, the surface area per pane, and the pattern used for the coating application.

Unlike traditional signal-enhancing infrastructure such as distributed antenna systems (DAS), the WAVETHRU material requires no maintenance, generates no CO₂ emissions, and has a long lifespan. It functions passively, with no energy input, offering a sustainable and cost-effective alternative for improving indoor mobile connectivity through architectural glazing.

This material innovation represents a strategic advancement in building-integrated technology—preserving the benefits of energy-efficient architecture while ensuring modern communication demands are met. By embedding signal-enhancing functionality directly into the glazing system, WAVETHRU effectively transforms conventional glass into a high-performance, multi-functional material for the connected built environment.","Smart Materials, Glass, facades",Glossy,100%,Closed,Smooth,Hard,Cool,Poor,None,Good,Good,Good,Good,Medium,Good,No

These developments have allowed the company to produce leather using renewable raw materials – setting a whole new standard in terms of sustainability.

The wet-green OBE tanning agent is prepared in a similar way to a natural tea extract. This extract is produced using only a by-product of the olive cultivation industry – the leaves. The wet-green tanning process permits the manufacture of biologically degradable premium leather with optimum skin compatibility on an industrial scale. A growing and continuously evolving environmental awareness among consumers is forcing producers and their brands to focus their attention on ecological considerations.

This universal dry leather semi-finished product requires no biocides and is suitable for all leather types. It is sulphide-free unhairing technology. The development of a safe unhairing technology arose as an alternative to currently used sulphur compounds. This eliminates the release of toxic hydrogen sulphide which could endanger leather workers, and also prevents noxious odours.

Since the start of forestry from about 70 years ago, this material starts being available in a bigger quantity now. During the research process, three main processes of boiling, burning and distilling were rendered. Inspired by the natural circulation of matter, nothing but water and heat were added to the wood and all byproducts were processed as valuable resources. By deconstructing the tree into micro scale and reassembling the found elements, the rendered new materials that could stand by themselves. All of them would be able to go back to the forest as nutrition. The rugged willow, which colonised Iceland after the last Ice Age, has not been given a great deal of attention.

As you change your viewing angle, the glass changes its appearance from clear to frosted, without requiring any electricity or other appliances. This film can be retrofitted to the interior side of any flat glass. It is available in 4 different types and the effect of the film works on both sides of the glass.

These 4 different types of film can be applied both vertically and horizontally, creating a great range of applications this film can be used for.

Firstly, WINCOS Vision Control Film can be used to adaptably provide privacy or security without compromising the view, giving you control of what can be seen from which angle. There are buildings such as hotels or offices where people deal with sensitive information and there is a need for security against prying eyes. Often when buildings are built closely together, one does not want the neighbors to be able to look straight inside, but still nobody likes to block their own view either. Thanks to Vision Control Film’s clever directional effect, your privacy can be protected from any angle. Also, with buildings becoming higher and higher, this film can protect those suffering from a fear of heights or vertigo and still provide a great view.

In addition, it can be used to create a novel effect. For instance, it can create the illusion that objects appear and disappear as people walk by, or make spectators take another look to see what is ‘hidden’ behind the glass.

WINCOS Vision Control Film is equipped with a hard-coated film surface for improved scratch-resistance and the glass is protected against shattering if broken. Approximately 88% of the visible light is transmitted by the film, regardless of whether it is clear or frosted, so the light within the building is not compromised. At the same time, damaging UV light transmission is significantly cut, protecting residents and furnishing. The clear parts of the film are made as transparent as possible; when applied it looks as if there is no film on the glass at all.

The product is available in the measurements 1250 mm x 15 m. It has a directional effect and is a thick film. The thickness of the film, including adhesive is approximately 315 microns for X and Y, and 480 microns for W and Z. The installation method therefore differs from that of a regular window film.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/wood-fiber-textiles/,Wood Fibre Textiles,Other naturals,ONA538,Austria,Lenzing,"We don’t often think about it, but a lot of textiles we use are made of wood. We all think of Viscose as a cotton material, but Viscose is actually a fibre made of cellulose and a brand name of the company Lenzing. In addition to Viscose, other brand fibres Lenzing make include the following: Tencel, Lenzing Modal and Lenzing FR.

Tencel is of botanical origin as it is extracted from the raw wood materials. Fibre production itself is extremely eco-friendly, due to the closed loop system. Textiles made of Tencel are more absorbent than cotton, softer than silk and cooler than linen. Applications for Tencel are versatile – the fibre finds applications ranging from mattresses and bed linens to sportswear as well as in hygiene products like wipes and diapers.

Lenzing Modal, a modal fibre from Lenzing, is naturally soft on the skin and very ecological. The fibre is produced using a special production process – pulp, the raw material, is produced at the same site as the Modal fibre itself. Production can thus be done while going easy on energy and other resources. Lenzing Modal is extracted from beechwood. The beech tree is quite unique and has grown in Europe for a very long time. Directly from beechwood forests, Lenzing Modal gives each and every textile a natural look and feel.

Lenzing FR, a cellulose fibre, protects against heat stress. Produced from beechwood as a natural raw material, Lenzing FR offers protection against heat and flame in a variety of different applications. Around the world, Lenzing FR is produced using the Lenzing Modal process. This ensures that the very highest fibre tenacities are obtained and makes it possible to insert the FR agent in a permanent manner. Lenzing FR offers protection from all kinds of heat: fire, radiant heat, electric arcs, molten metals and flash fires. The most important goal of protective clothing is to prevent the skin from burning. After all, the skin is the body’s largest and most sensitive organ.

Lenzing Viscose is also produced from the renewable raw material of wood. As a result of its cellulosic origin, it is naturally botanical, absorbs moisture well and is pleasant on the skin.

It isn’t only quality that plays a major role in Lenzing’s textiles. Lenzing also gives priority to environmental protection and sustainability. The various chemical and waste products which result from the production process are recycled or sold. One example is xylose which is used as a sweetener by the food industry.","Biobased, Ecology, Sustainable, Other naturals, fabrics, textiles",Matte,0%,Open,Medium,Resilient,Warm,Moderate,None,Good,Moderate,Poor,Moderate,Light,Moderate,Yes

Circulair Warenhuis works with high-quality reclaimed wood as a sustainable alternative to traditional wood. The company’s furniture panels and furniture are made from reclaimed wood, sourced from old buildings, discarded furniture, and urban environments. This circular material not only extends the life of valuable raw materials but also ensures exceptional durability and character.

Unlike untreated wood, reclaimed wood is less prone to warping and splitting while maintaining a strong, robust structure through careful processing and finishing. This makes it an ideal choice for a variety of applications, including furniture, interior panels, and wall coverings. With its natural patina and unique grain structure, each piece develops its own distinctive appearance, making it suitable for both modern and industrial interiors.

Beyond its technical benefits, reclaimed wood represents a conscious step toward a more sustainable future. By repurposing existing materials, Circulair Warenhuis reduces the demand for new wood, helps prevent deforestation, and contributes to a circular economy. Its production process minimizes waste, lowers CO₂ emissions, and supports local craftsmen dedicated to creating unique furniture pieces with a story.

The furniture panels and furniture are available in a range of shades and finishes and can be custom-made for efficient installation with minimal material waste.

It is even older than originally speculated. In 2001, Spanish archaeologists, digging in the desert sands of Tanzania, recovered flint tools worn to an extent that could only result from heavy-duty activity, namely: woodcarving. These findings date back to 3000 BC.

What may be a surprise is that most common wood furniture-making techniques and tools used today date from that period, including carving, the dowel, mortise and tenon joints, the adze, chisel, saw, awl, and bow drill. Other techniques, such as the dovetail joint, halving joints and shoulder miters, were introduced a 1000 years later, around 2000 BC.

The craftsman of Cravt Original prefer the use of Acacia wood for the creation of their woodcarved panels. Acacia wood is a light hardwood favoured for its fine grain and natural flame like design or surface pattern. Because it takes a high polish, it is often used for ornamental purposes.

The Acacia, also known as a thorn tree or wattle, is a fast growing tree that flourishes even in poor soil. But, great results can only be achieved thanks to the dedication of skilled and talented artisans. These artisans are able to anticipate wood variations and justly account for them in order to maximize the strength and utility of the finished product.

https://materialdistrict.com/material/xyhlo/,Xyhlo,Coatings,COA183,Netherlands,Xyhlo Biofinish,"Xyhlo biofinish is a durable and 100% environmentally friendly method for protecting wood, especially in outdoor applications. The Xyhlo biofinish is created as an organic protective layer on the timber by first processing the wood with a natural oil (linseed oil), and then applying an organic coating based on a non-hazardous and naturally occurring fungus. As a result, native, less durable wood species can still be protected long term. After the expiry of the technical service life of the wood, the timber can be completely returned to the natural biological cycle.

Xyhlo biofinish therefore does not need to be burned, meaning it adds no (extra) life cycle carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Xhylo biofinish is thus C02 and climate neutral.

Self-healing: Xyhlo biofinish forms a live black protective layer that is able to repair itself when damaged, for example by cracking or splitting, but also to damage from the outside. Xyhlo biofinish is in the first years of use even better, in contrast to conventional coatings, which degrade and always have to be renewed in the course of time.

The principle of operation of the protective organic coating is based on the presence of active fungal cells and chlamydospores which adhere by biopolymers to the wood. Xyhlo biofinish not only protects against climatic conditions, but also to degradation by UV radiation and other fungi. It offers great advantages for applications such as cladding, sound screens and gazebos.

Electromagnetic radiation is a particular form of the more general electromagnetic field (EM field), which is produced by moving, charged particles.

The radio signals emitted by mobile phones also generate small but significant amounts of electromagnetic radiation (EMR), which is as good as in several different forms of radiating energy waves including microwaves, infrared light, ultraviolet light, X-rays, gamma rays and even visible light.

A cell phone’s transmitter converts your voice into an electrical signal, which it then dispatches as radio frequency energy, another form of electromagnetic radiation. Protecting, shielding and blocking this is sometimes the only way to reduce the levels of electromagnetic radiation.

The Zebra material, named for its distinctive striped appearance, is a novel way to process limestone. Rigorous selection of the strips ensures that there are very few open carbon layers, fewer than ‘normal’ blocks of blue stone. Usual extraction from quarries, and processing of Belgian blue limestone into a finished product , leads to about 50% leftover material, often in relatively small sizes.

The manufacturer processes these leftovers and saws them into strips, which are then glued together. The material is a semi-finished product, that comes as a large slab of natural stone that can be made to measure in a normal stonecutter company.

Further characteristics are a consistent quality within a highly reliable composition, a relatively low ecological footprint and suitability for application both inside and outside. An interesting architectural detail is the use of mathematically controlled incremental sizes. The Fibonacci sequence (two previous numbers are added to form the third, so the sequence starts: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, …) is used to generate a set of Zebra stones that will tile easily.

Furthermore, the facing brick will absorb the rainwater because of its porous structure and will dry out more quickly because of the open structure of a ZERO wall. # if ZERO bricks are layed carefully, little mortar will be visible. Downside: The need of more bricks per square mtr : +/- 90 bricks per m&sup2; More Technical details: Mortar consumption: Consumption is approximately 45kg/m&sup2;, obviously depending on the operator.",Ceramics,Matte,0%,Open,Medium,Hard,Cool,Moderate,None,Good,Good,Good,Moderate,Medium,Moderate,No
https://materialdistrict.com/material/zinc-foam/,Zinc Foam,Metals,MET104,Germany,Fraunhofer Chemnitz,"A lightweight foamed metal which is also self-skinning. Originally developed with aeronautical applications in mind, this material has great casting capabilities. It achieves great volume and strength whilst using minimal resources. In fact the honeycomb effect found within the foam bubble matrix actually increases the structural integrity of the materials due to the random diffusion of stress lines. For applications where energy absorption is important, the main competitor of zinc foam is aluminum foam. One disadvantage of aluminum foams is that they cannot be produced in Diecasting at this time.The strength of Zinc Diecastings in shear, in torsion, under bending and in compression are all far superior to aluminium, magnesium and plastics. Two methods for foaming metals were used in early days; In the first of these, gas is injected continuously to create foam. In the second method, gas-releasing propellants are added to the melt, akin to the blowing agents of the plastic foam industry or indeed the yeast of the baker",Metals,Matte,0%,Closed,Medium,Hard,Medium,Moderate,None,Moderate,Moderate,Good,Moderate,Light,Moderate,No
